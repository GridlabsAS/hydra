1,"Bill,
 
To get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet).  Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows.  She is completely independent from the hotel and I'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has.  They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket.  It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see.  I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now.  You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead.  Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town.
 
Rent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first .
 
I agree with John, your best hotel bet is the Marriott Marquis, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best.
 
Don't forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast!
 
Keep us posted.  
 
Kim.

Gosh, that sounds great!
 
It's been more than 5 years since we've been to NYC, but here's what I'd do...this weekend, look around BR (that's Baton Rouge) for the Sunday issue of the New York Times.  Look in the Lifestyle section (or the NYT equivalent) and you'll undoubtedly see ads for weekend specials and/or package deals to the city, possibly including airfare, hotel, theater tickets, meals, airport transfers, etc.
 
Other than that, you can check out the Marriott Marquis Hotel, which has its own theater and may offer special weekend rates.  Don't gasp when you find out that a room is going to run you $200/night ++, that's just the going rate for a very expensive city.
 
You'll need to visit the TKTS booth in Times Square, where folks queue up mid-morning for half-priced same-day tickets to some great shows...and some real dogs.  You won't find any Producers tickets there, unfortunately, but Rent may be available.  See Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables, for sure.
 
Grab lunch at the Carnegie Deli, but don't fall on the floor when you order the $18 reuben sandwich.  Pay the $3 split fee and share it with Teri.  Note the huge desserts and the terse wait staff.
 
See if the Rainbow Room is still open for dinner and dancing.  Kim and I celebrated our 10th anniversary there with Mike & Cheryl Pope (it was Cheryl's 40th BD, too).  The Rainbow Room is in Rockefeller Center (where NBC is located).
 
Everything is going to be expensive, so get used to it.
 
Let me know what you decide!
 
BTW, how's Poppy?  Mom said he's made an amazing comeback from the brink...

Bro:
 
I am thinking of suprosing Teri for our 20th anniversary.  I would like to take her for a quick trip to NYC.  I would really like to get tickets to The Producers but it appears to be sold out until March, 2001.
 
If we make the trip, in what part of town do you suggest we stay?  What hotel has reasonable prices?  We  would like to go to a play.  Other than that, I have absolutely no ideas.  Any ideas as to which play we can get tickets to at this late date?  Rent is still available and I've heard good things about it.
 
I would appreciate any help you can lend.

Subject: RE: EFET Meeting with the CREG/Union Miniere feedback

 Ross, Paul

We had good feedback from Union Miniere on the Belgian situation yesterday.  
Apparently the Febeliec press release on the competitive situation in Belgium 
went down very badly in the government.  Febeliec got a letter back saying 
that the govt was ""disappointed and unhappy"" with the letter, noting that the 
govt priorities were the Belgian presidency of the EU, the finances of the 
communes (whose finances are of course completely wrapped up with 
Electrabel's extraction of revenues from captive customers) and something 
along the lines of ""preserving the traditions of Belgian electricity 
supply"".  Furthermore, there are suggestions of veiled threats (not from the 
government directly, but from those working closely with govt) of 
""retribution"" ( taxes/environmental burdens) -presumably if Febeliec don't 
lay off.  Also confirmed Bruno's CREG feedback that border issues are not a 
priority.

UM however is going to persist.  Senior management (Marcel Goetstouwers, VP 
of Purchasing & Transportation) wants us to go back next week and present to 
him why exactly we can't commit to delivering firm on the Belgian grid next 
year and what it takes for us to be able to do so.  He intends to use this 
material in his upcoming meeting with the Minister.  We have of course been 
explaining all along the difficulties, but it has taken their recent Belgian 
tender (in response to which they received no offers apart from their 
Electrabel offer plus our OTM option) for him to take the issues seriously.  
UM is also talking again about complaints to the Commission, which they may 
actually do now (possibly).  

Our OTM option remains on the table and we can discuss it again after their 
visit to the Minister.

Against this background, the CREG refusal to meet with Enron is obviously 
symptomatic of the general attitude of the govt.  EFET Belgium needs to take 
this into account in moving forward. (Bruno - why not get some feedback 
directly, and independently, from Febeliec - and see if it confirms or not 
UM's report.)

On the test sale to Electrabel on the Belgian grid, I will take this forward 
with Jonathan on his return on Tuesday.  Following the recent 
pressure/letters from us on the issue to CPTE, they had indicated ARP trading 
on the grid would be in place by 1 July but this has since slipped to Sep or 
Oct, and of course, there is no CPTE commitment on paper anyway (a promised 
press release on the subject is probably being saved for the announcement of 
the nomination of the TS0, expected 21 July).  It will be interesting to see 
if Electrabel still give us a price, since there have been CPTE/Electrabel 
discussions on the matter since we raised it.

Bruno,

As you say not unexpected!  

Were they quoting the govt in terms of their intentions to not open the 
market?  How does this approach play in terms of the Belgium presidency?

As a simple example, we face the ludicrous situation that CPTE allows us to 
wheel power through Belgium from Fr to NL (et vv) but refuses to allow us to 
buy from or sell to Electrabel - with significant implications for the Dutch 
as well as Belgium markets, given Electrabel's strong position in both 
markets.  In that this is a cross border issue the EU ie TREN and/or COMP 
should take more interest.......but probably only if prodded by the Dutch to 
conisder it more of a priority (and pigs might fly on that one?)?

Obviously position of TREN key on this - what hot buttons can we press 
(assuming Dutch do nothing)?  Is there action that could be taken or 
threatened against Electrabel (although this would obviously need to be 
justified by lengthy and difficult abuse investigation or such like).  Is the 
reported Electrabel/Distrigas ""concert"" another angle to raise with 
TREM/COMP?  Could CPTE be fined?

Regards,

Ross

Subject: EFET Meeting with the CREG - Elect. and Gas

The meeting yesterday with the CREG was very disappointing although not 
surprising. We met Christine VANDERVEEREN - President and Department for 
dispute settlement, Thomas LEKANE - Director of the technical operation of 
the electricity market,  Jean-Paul PINON - Director of the technical 
operation of the gas market, and Fran?ois POSSEMIERS - Director of gas price 
control. The attitude of Ms VANDERVEEREN was one of resignation and apathy, 
Mr. LEKANE was very defensive (and did not seem to understand the issues i.e. 
did not understand the exchanging of energy blocks), M. PINON was the only 
one that seemed pro-active, open and wiling to listen to market participants, 
and Mr. POSSEMIERS did not say anything. 

Electricity

We presented the situation - no access to market/transit, quasi monopoly 
situation at the detriment to consumers,  no wholesale and retail market, no 
wholesale trading allowed. We insisted that in the short -term, capacity 
should be available on a UIOLI bases, block exchanges should be put in place 
ASAP. They indicated that only the strict minimum was going to be implemented 
in the short run. In particular, at the end of the meeting M. Vanderverren 
told me that the government had no intention of opening up the market for 
competition and that their only intention was to focus on internal market 
issues, and not border issues, to insure the transposition of the directive 
to fend off the Commission's latest  infringement action. 
  
The CREG is still operating under the ""we have no power"" mode. The tension 
between the CREG and the ministry is obvious and politically motivated. The 
CREG gives the impression that they are subject to the ministry's power, they 
are only acting as an administrator for the ministry in providing advice on 
proposed legislation.   The CREG continues to claim that they are not able to 
impose any rules or regulation on CPTE as CPTE is not the nominated TSO. They 
also seem to fend off any offer for us to consult on any issues other than 
draft decrees and certain ""indicative plans"" that are envisage (see below). 

Status of TSO designation:
The TSO should be nominated on 21/7. All important decrees will be passed by 
the 20/7. This includes the grid code, tariff related decrees (need 
precisions), and a new decree requiring licensing for intermediaries 
(including suppliers and traders).  Regarding this issue, the CREG is against 
additional licences but see this requirement unavoidable (due to political 
will), and asked that we provide them with comments once the proposed decree 
is available (with the condition that there will be very little time to 
provide for comments)        

Grid Code
According to a prior conversation I had with the secretary cabinet, the grid 
code should be issued by the end of June at the latest. They are still 
considering including a concentration process on specific issues. EFET will 
be scheduling a meeting with the cabinet shortly.   

Border capacity allocation:
It seems that the only change in allocation that they are considering is one 
that would implement auctions by 2002 (this what they consider to be the 
short term solution). In the long term Leanne explained that the preferred 
solution would be market splitting. They are not considering any type on 
UIOLI procedure in the immediate (despite our stressing that this should be 
easily implementable).

Trading Arrangements:
We also insisted on the need to implement ASAP block exchange procedures. It 
seemed that Lekane did not understand the issue and implied that his comments 
on  the grid code did not envisage that because of the limited time they had 
to offer comments to the ministry. (Again in previous conversation with the 
energy cabinet they are considering to include that notion and are possibly 
looking to ask for a formal consultation process)

Envisaged Consultation:
Electric: 
 Decree on licences,
 Projected demand for the next ten years - projected imports, exports and 
transits - need for production
Gas: 
 Projected demand for the next ten years - the need for flexibility, 
competition, ....
 New Grid Code: Changes to the existing proposed grid code to incorporate the 
new law.  

Next steps:
EFET decided to try meet with the Energy cabinet within two weeks. Is 
Envisaging meeting with Christopher Jones by the end of the month.
Enron is continuing to actively talk with the Energy Cabinet (next issue to 
discuss are UIOLI capacity allocation, trading arrangements). June 6 Meeting 
with DGTREN to expose barriers in BE market. (At the end of the CREG meeting 
I asked that they meet with Enron and the responded that they did not have 
the time)

Cal PUC.  If not, I think that you should be.  Now that Fawcett has left TW 
and Susan Scott's in our shop in Houston with Christie, I'm a little 
concerned about TW (I don't have as much time to monitor anymore).  Be great 
if you got involved.

Hope all is well with you and yours.

 Have you a chance to look into this?  We are required to clear intercompany 
variances by the end of the month, so it would help if you could research 
this as soon as possible.  Thanks for your help.

Stacy,

 I have an intercompany deal which I am missing one side of.  HPL purchased 
gas from Dynegy (deal 96378) and sold to ENA (deal97185) on Oasis Pipeline 
(meter 1335).   I can't find ENA's purchase from HPL.  Please let me know 
what  you find out.  This is affecting our intercompany report and we need to 
have it cleaned as soon as possible. Thanks

Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would 
like more information 

(Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect 
confidentiality  - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential 
right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we 
don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties)



*EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against 
TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  Judge Edgar 
has been assigned the matter.

*The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA 
entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA).

*The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of 
TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to 
schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at 
the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at 
the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.  EPMI believes 
that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue.  

*A trial date in late June 2000 has been set.

*EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.

Subject: Letter of Intent


	


Gentlemen,

I have received a fax confirmation of Mr. Bruciak's execution of the 
Confidentiality Agreement this afternoon.  Thank you.

Attached is a draft Letter of Intent (""LOI"") pertaining to our discussions 
about the feasibility and development of an approximate 500 MW power station 
sited at or near the Port of Brownsville.  The LOI is structured similarly to 
the existing Participation Agreement, wherein BPUB and ENA exclusively 
collaborate to investigate the feasibility of the power station and secure a 
suitable site, if justified.  It is proposed that ENA cover the costs of the 
development effort, including permitting and site acquisition, with such 
costs being eventually treated as either Project construction costs or 
operating costs, depending upon the nature of the expense.  I have also 
proposed that ENA pay BPUP a $10,000 Consulting Fee to cover any outside 
expenses associated with the drafting and execution of this agreement and the 
site option agreement(s).  The proposed term of the LOI expires 31 December 
2001, unless either of us determines earlier that the joint effort will not 
be successful.  During the term of the LOI, it is proposed that BPUB and ENA 
will determine and agree upon an appropriate Project equity participation and 
finance structure.

Something we may want to consider is the transfer of BPUB's equity in the 
Oklaunion plant in exchange for equity in the new Cameron County plant.  This 
would be especially appealing if BPUB's interest in Oklaunion also included 
switching rights through the nearby DC Tie and if there are additional 
Oklaunion interests available with DC Tie switching rights.  

Please let know a convenient time when we talk through the proposed LOI and 
address any of your questions.

JMoore

1. Introduction

Rotation abounds on the Big Chart as some of the formerly
weak groups are showing some signs of life, while some of
the stronger groups are starting to see their high
percentile rankings slip.  Speculation about lower interest
rates, a growing consensus that the Nasdaq has established
a bottom, and seasonal factors are all spurring the
reallocation of investment dollars.

2. Groups that are Heating Up

This week's analysis starts right at the top of the Big
Chart with the banking sector.  All three industry groups
within the sector - Banks {.BAN}, Banks/Savings & Loan
{.BSL}, and Banks/Savings Banks {.BSB} - saw their
respective rankings rise last week.  The primary driver
behind this move was an improved interest rate outlook,
though Joe Morford at Dain Rauscher Wessels noted that
merger activity is picking up.  Among the best performers
were Century South {CSBI} (announced merger with BB&T
{BBT}), Charter One Financial {CF}, Imperial Bancorp {IMP}
(testing resistance), and Comerica {CMA}.

Selected groups within the electronics sector improved their
rankings.  Electronics/Motors rebounded back to the 85th
percentile after briefly dropping from green to yellow, two
weeks ago.  The group is being powered by electronics
conglomerate Emerson {EMR}, which set a new record high.
The Electronics/Semiconductors {.ESE} group seems to have
found a bottom, though it still remains among the worst
performing industry groups.  Nonetheless, it's worth noting
that the group's ranking has fallen below the tenth
percentile just twice since the beginning of October.
Electronics/Specialty instruments began its recovery after
posting a big drop on the Big Chart two weeks ago, with
gains by Zygo {ZIGO}, Newport Corporation {NEWP}, and
Trimble Navigation {TRMB}.

Other industry groups that gained ground last week include
Chemicals {.CHE}, Computer/Components {DCO},
Drugs/Biotechnology {.DBI}, Leisure/Race Tracks {.LRT},
Retail/Stores/Discount {.RDI}, and Retail/Stores/Specialty
{.RSP}, which improved its ranking for the fourth consecutive
week.

____________________________________________________________

3. Groups that are Cooling Off

Market sentiment finally coalesced with respect to the
entire utilities sector, and that sentiment was toward
profit taking.  Utilities/Diversified {.UDI} fell out of the
top quintile for the first time in five weeks and only the
second time since the beginning of October.  PG&E {PCG} fell
by more than 10 percent after the president of the California
Public Utilities Commission, Lorretta Lynch, said that
requests for electric rate increases by PCG and Southern
California Edison were premature.  Utilities/Gas/Producer-Gatherer
{.UPG} also dropped out of the top quintile, while
Utilities/Electric/Holding {.UHO} is threatening to turn from
green to yellow.

The beverage sector - which includes Beverages {.BEV},
Beverages/Beer & Ale {.BBA}, Beverages/Bottlers {.BBO},
Beverages/Distillers {.BDI}, Beverages/Soft Drink Syrup
{.BSD} - weakened as investors began funneling more money
into the tech sector.

Other groups that that fell on the Big Chart include
Energy/Oil-Gas/Domestic {.ODO}, Leisure/Casinos-Gaming {.LCG},
Vehicles/Truck-Trailers {.ATT}, and Homes/Hotels-Motels-Inns
{.HOT} - a group that we noted last week was likely to fall.

4. On the Radar Screen this Week

The retail sector could be worth watching over the next few
weeks as holiday shopping picks up.  Though many stores are
relying on discounts to draw in consumers, certain industry
groups within the sector have been improving their rankings;
these groups include Retail/Stores/Department {.RDE},
Retail/Stores/Discount {.RDI}, and the aforementioned
Retail/Stores/Specialty {.RSP}.  Stocks that are performing
well in these groups include Footstar {FTS}, Bebe Stores
{BEBE} and Target {TGT}.

____________________________________________________________

5. Stock In Focus

Foostar {FTS} has more than survived the volatility of the
past several weeks with a six-week gain of 32.0 percent. The
company saw same-store sales increase 13.5 percent in
November and could be on its way to posting a strong December;
particularly since FTS has a history of exceeding analyst
expectations by notable margins.  Footstar operates the
Footaction and Just for Feet chains and, last month, agreed
to acquire the footwear division of J. Baker {JBAK}.

Subject: Asset Financing - Structured Finance Presentation

We are planning a presentation on certain structure and contracting issues 
related to power plant asset financing on Thursday, May 10th.  The 
presentation will include lunch from Treebeard's and will begin at 11:30.  We 
have scheduled 2.5 hours for the presentation; it may be shorter, depending 
on the number of questions. 

We plan to include the Portland folks by video-conference.   If you know of 
others who would benefit from this presentation, please pass on this 
invitation; I have not intended to exclude anyone who may want to attend.  If 
there are others at remote locations, please let me or Dina Snow know so that 
we can arrange for video-conferencing.  John, I asked Shirley for the names 
of your contracts folks and have included them; I still have no information 
as to whom else you want to include.  Therefore, please forward this to your 
team members as you see fit.

Please RSVP to Dina Snow at X57099 or by e-mail to dina.snow@enron.com by 
Tuesday, May 8th.

We will e-mail the conference room location when it is confirmed.


Thanks,

Rose

I can be your contact for Louisiana Resources.  However, as I stated earlier, I need to know which Louisiana Resources you are talking about.  Is it Louisiana Resources Company or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership.

For Bridgeline the contact would be Robert D. Morgan.  His phone number is 713-345-6374.

Gerald, this is just to follow up on the voicemail message I left for you
this afternoon.  Can you please provide me with contact information for reps
from both Louisiana Resources and Bridgeline.  The transfer of control
applications to be filed with the FCC require signatures from reps from both
parties to the transaction.  We will need this info before we can file the
applications.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

50% control with only 40% interest?

Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:

     1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
     2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are
currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.
     3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new
after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info?
     4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you
forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.
Do you agree, Robert?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They
were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's
40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these
licenses has been filed.

Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the
licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into
Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America
Corp.

   Gerald, this is just to follow up on our prior phone conversations re:
   the
   sale of Louisiana Resources' assets (including licenses) to Bridgeline .
   As
   I mentioned, what is important to our inquiry is whether transfer of
   applications were filed prior to the consummation of the above
   transaction
   whereby the assets of Louisiana Resources' were acquired.  I will need
   the
   following transaction information:

   *  When did the transaction close?  The exact date. 2/?/2000
   *  Which licenses where part of that transaction?
   *  Which licenses were obtained by filing a new application after the
   transaction date?
   *  Which stations are constructed/operating?

   As a reminder, we are under a deadline to get this information to the
   FCC.
   To make the deadline I will need the information by tomorrow or Monday
   at
   the latest.  Please call/email with any questions.

   Thanks and have a Happy Thanksgiving.

I was thinking that although this is testimony before COngress, it would also be good cover for FERC.  Do you or Sarah or Christi know if FERC does or can include Congressional testimony in their analysis or can they only use formal intervention type documents?  I was just thinking that whoever interacts with FERC in the DC office could make sure that they have a copy?

employees to give us a list of what they know we would probably need to deal 
with historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as 
well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer 
and asset transactions. 

Have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to

The following summarizes the decisions made during our  user & IT joint 
meeting today regarding the handling of CES historical data.

A.  Bryce Baxter will coordinate with all user groups to identify CES reports 
that need to be actually printed as hard copy or transfered to files that 
will be accessed               via the Electronic Document Management system.
B.  Jeff Peoples will be working with Bryce Baxter to produce reports using 
CES system via ISDN line at Enron building - this will continue to be part of 
his duty until  the job is done (Jeff joined ENA as a member of Sitara group).
C.  Larry Daze will be working with Jeff Peoples and Bryce Baxter to ensure 
all reports are loaded on our EDMS with proper indexing.
D.  No need for manupulating CES history data is necessary  (i.e. downloading 
on spreadsheets).  Therefore, no data will be kept on the disk other than 
EDMS.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced today that Ivan Boileau has been named g=
eneral manager of Garden State Paper, its recycled newsprint mill in Garfie=
ld, New Jersey.  Ivan was formerly the assistant general manager of Enron's=
 Papiers Stadacona paper mill in Quebec City, where he was responsible for =
pulping, paper machine operations and maintenance. Under Ivan's leadership,=
 Garden State Paper is expected to increase annual production, as well as p=
roduce higher quality recycled newsprint at a lower cost.
Enron acquired Garden State Paper in July 2000 and Papiers Stadacona in Apr=
il 2001. The acquisition of both mills now positions Enron as the seventh l=
argest producer of newsprint in North America. Enron began offering various=
 financial hedges to the Forest Products industry in 1997, and today is the=
 world's leading provider of customized financial risk management services =
to both buyers and sellers of pulp, paper and wood products. In addition, E=
nron provides capital services, inventory management and long-term fixed pr=

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Some very good news just in from Spain.  Last week, Enron Espa?a Generaci?n=
 and Enagas reached a long-term agreement whereby Enagas will provide Enron=
 Espa?a Generaci?n with regasification and transport services of natural ga=
s of approximately 1,7bcm annually between Huelva and our planned combined =

 begin in 2004, a date that coincides with our planned schedule for commenc=
ement of operations for the plant.  Well done to all the team.

Enron launches derivatives for three new tanker freight routes in shipping =
market
Enron's tanker freight team has this past week increased their derivatives =
portfolio (freight futures or 'swaps' of monthly contracts up to four month=
s out) for three new tanker freight routes on EnronOnline. The tanker freig=
ht derivatives will be benchmarked against published indices for the three =
routes on the 'Baltic International' (BITRA) and International Independent =
Tanker Rate Assessment (IITRA) exchanges to help ship-owners (including oil=
 companies), charterers, traders and even banks with exposure to the shippi=
ng market, mitigate the volatility of the freight element of tanker voyages=
 traveling from Singapore to Japan (30,000 tonnes), the Caribbean to the US=
 Gulf (70,000 tonnes) and Rotterdam to New York (33,000 tonnes).  Derivativ=
es for the three routes will be managed out of the Singapore, Houston and L=
ondon offices respectively.  ""Volatility of the tanker freight market has b=
een as high as 62% on some routes,"" explains Scott Moncrieff, Enron's direc=
tor of Liquids Freight Trading, based in London.  ""This has increased the i=
mportance of freight in relative terms on most tanker routes""=20

""In nine months we have already traded more than 3 million tonnes of paper =
freight, with a value of more than USD 14 million on the existing 80,000 to=
nne Sullom Voe (North Sea) to Willemshaven (Germany) route, and we expect t=
o achieve similar levels of interest on our three new routes.  The tanker f=
reight market is estimated to be worth more than USD 15 billion annually, a=
nd with increased liquidity being brought to the sector because of more pla=
yers entering the market there's plenty of opportunity for us to build our =
business.""

The tanker freight team is also very heavily involved in the physical chart=
ering of tanker vessels in Europe, The Americas, Arabian Gulf, Mediterranea=
n, Far East and US West Coast, utilizing both the spot shipping market and =
Enron-controlled 'time-charter' vessels.

Nordic Pre-Pay Deal
The Nordic origination team has closed their first municipality power pre-p=
ay deal in the last week. This is the first deal to be completed based on a=
 financing structure that Enron Nordic Energy negotiated with Den Norske Ba=
nk earlier this summer. The deal is an important reference for municipaliti=
es that are interested in raising cash without selling their ownership in l=
ocal power companies.

Steel Products
In March 2001 the European Steel Group commenced operations as an expansion=
 of the successful effort underway in North America.  The group offers both=
 physical and financial commodity grade steel products and serves as the on=
ly market-maker for a commodity market that is larger than that of crude oi=
l.  The mission is to introduce the concept of indexation and financial con=
tract to an industry where price transparency and risk management are virtu=
ally non-existent.  Physical and financial contracts for hot rolled and col=
d rolled steel are currently on offer via EnronOnline.  Interest from Europ=
ean producers and end-users is keen with the first financial transactions e=
xpected to close by the end of Q3.=20

Since the team's inception they have successfully completed transactions wi=
th counterparties in Kazakhstan, Egypt, and China amounting to nearly 50,00=
0 metric tonnes of steel. =20

Forest Products
Enron's European Forest Products group is now trading physical market pulp =
to complement the financial derivatives products already offered for the la=
st 2 years, increasing the volume under contract by 30%.=20

Over the past six months, the group has recruited physical pulp traders to =
handle its day-to-day physical pulp trading business.  ""We have sourced lon=
g-term physical supplies of ""market pulp"" from around the world which will =
complement the financial derivative products we have already been offering,=
"" explains Martin Holmes, Director of Enron's European Forest Product Opera=
tions.

By trading both physical and financial contracts, Enron is pioneering more =
creative pricing in the industry by offering physical and financial cash an=
d forward prices, as well as being the only market maker to quote longer da=
ted swaps.

The group is also actively looking at structured finance opportunities incl=
uding a number of inventory deals. These opportunities have arisen as the b=
enchmark pulp price for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK) has fallen =
by 45% over the past 6 months, leaving producers with high levels of pulp i=
nventory in warehouses.

On 2nd July, the group launched the first standard contract for Bleached Eu=
calyptus (BEK) pulp on EnronOnline, and is actively marketing to industry b=
rokers to adopt the contract as the benchmark index for pricing. The contra=
ct meets the commodity specifications of the BEK contract on the London Pul=
pex futures exchange, where Enron is the only market maker for all pulp fut=
ures contracts offered.

3,"Steve--

I hope things are going well for you.  LaRence Snowden told me he met with 
you last week to discuss opportunities for him within the Regulatory group.  
As a courtesy follow-up to that meeting, I wanted to tell you about him and 
the skills I think he possesses.  LaRence spent 2000 working for 3 different 
bosses in EBS, and when the music stopped with me at the helm, he had not 
produced enough identifiable work product for any one of us to be able to 
fall on our sword for him.  The double whammy was that he was at the point of 
aging out of the Associate program and in need of a commercial position.  In 
my opinion, LaRence was not suited to the type of work I need my people to do 
in EBS Structuring, and I had to pass on a promotion for him.  His ranking 
stems from the fact that he couldn't keep up with the other Associates in the 
group with respect to hard-core models and business analysis.  We eventually 
put him in the role of implementation, where his main objectives have been to 
identify and overcome barriers to getting a deal up and running, which 
everyone agrees is his strength.  He has good internal networking skills, is 
a hard worker, knows Enron, and communicates the essentials to management.  
If that's what your team needs, he may be a fit.  Hopefully this goes without 
saying, but please don't think of this as a ""no-look pass.""  LaRence needs to 
find a home on his own merits.  I just promised him that I would tell people 
the background details of his situation when appropriate.

Thanks for talking to him and please call me if you have questions,
Brad Richter

Each quarter I will evaluate the classes (mainly attendance) to see how well 
they are performing.  Then I will be able to make adjustments to the schedule 
accordingly.  Our goal is to get people to try new things and not just go 
back to what they did before.  We have spent a lot of time and money getting 
brand new weights, spinning bikes and cardio equipment in here and want you 
all to have a chance to try it out.  Just give this schedule a try for a 
while when we open and keep me posted with your feedback.  Thanks!

Subject: Re: Body Shop Group Exercise Schedule  

Ann, do you think if there is not as many people participating in the 
spinning classes at lunch, you would offer additional spinning classes in the 
evening?  I noticed there is a spinning class offered every day at lunch but 
only one class offered in the evening.   There  are numerous people who were 
hoping to enjoy spinning two times a week but due to our work environment we 
are only able to work out in the evenings, period.     In addition,  we were 
hoping to do Bootcamp the other two remaining evenings, which looks like 
right now it is only offered on Monday and previously it was offered both 
Monday and  Wednesday.   

Is it possible that  if you do not have very much participation for the 
""total body conditioning class""  on Tuesday & Thursday you could replace it 
with another spin class and another bootcamp class.    Or maybe the ""total 
body conditioning class"" could be moved to  Monday and Wednesday and then it 
would free up the studio to have Bootcamp on Tuesday & Thrusday.   Then if 
you hopefully add another spin class you could insert it on Monday so you 
would be offering an evening spin class both Monday and Wednesday.   That 
would be wonderful.    

Also do you think before the spin class (s) in the evening  an ""ab lab"" class 
could be added before the beginning of class like at 5:30 pm?   

Any feedback you have would be great.   For a lot of us who have to work-out 
in the evenings only we hoping to be able to at least do a spin class  
acouple of times and then a boot camp a couple of times.     If  there is 
enough particiaption for this do you know how long it will take to get set 
up?   

Thank you for all of you help, comments or suggestons.

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+
to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause
to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those
provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the
other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC
clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the
L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on
this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and
congratulations.

Regards,

Steve

1,"I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

Subject: golf

Mike,

Can you join us on Wednesday morning, November 15 to play golf at Canyon 
Springs golf course in San Antonio prior to the Enron Management Conference? 
Canyon Springs will allow us to book a 10:00am tee time thirty days in 
advance. Once I have confirmed the tee time I will forward directions to the 
course. Should be a fun group. Might even need a practice round at Champions 
prior to the trip.

Despite the personal pleasure that I would derive from seeing Glynn and Richard strike out big time, it's not worth the price to ratepayers of letting these pirates (yes, pirates!) rip off so many valuable assets that should stay under PUC regulation for the benefit of consumers.

3,"You obviously know far more than me....but I was just reading the following=
:

        THE LATE-SEASON storm has killed at least four people from Colombia
to Dutch St. Maarten in the northeast Caribbean.
       On Tuesday, two fishermen drowned off Colombia=0F's Caribbean penins=
ula,
and rains destroyed half of a coastal village, leaving 540 people homeless.
       One man died in the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, after he fell of=
f
a ladder as he tried to board up windows. A man in St. Maarten died
Wednesday when the garden wall of his hillside home collapsed on him.
       The hurricane was unlikely to strike the mainland United States, sai=
d
meteorologist Stacy Stewart at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. He
cautioned, however, that Lenny still could bring heavy surf capable of
eroding beaches in Florida.
       =0F""The influence of this storm is going to be felt considerable
distances away,=0F"" he said.

       In St. Croix, an unidentified tourist who ventured out of a hotel to
see the rising surf was carried away by waves and had to cling to a rock fo=
r
more than an hour before local divers rescued him, said Gov. Charles
Turnbull of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
       Even before the hurricane arrived, storm surges that whipped up
12-foot waves stripped sand from Anguilla=0F's famous beaches. The beaches,
which attract tourists who provide the British island=0F's biggest source o=
f
revenue, already had been damaged by Hurricane Jose last month.
       Nearly 100 tourists had to be evacuated from a flooded hotel to
another hotel on higher ground in Anguilla.

A SEEMINGLY BACKWARD STORM
       Hurricane Lenny is a late-season storm with a seemingly backward
trajectory from west to east that surprised even seasoned forecasters.
       Feeding off the warm Caribbean waters, Lenny=0F's winds strengthened=
 to
150 mph Wednesday, just 5 mph short of being a Category 5 hurricane, the
strongest hurricane rating. Category 5 hurricanes can cause catastrophic
damage. By Thursday morning, the storm had weakened to 135 mph.

           In San Juan, a few motorists speeded down highways usually choke=
d
with traffic and tooted their horns with delight that the storm, which
zigzagged on a course that confounded meteorologists, had missed them. But
nearly 100,000 people remained without water or electricity Wednesday night=
.
       The eye of the storm was expected to pass close to the Dutch
territories of St. Maarten, St. Eustatius, Saba and the British island of
Anguilla.
       Anguilla was drenched by 4 to 6 inches of rain in four hours
Wednesday afternoon, and its beaches were eroded by sea swells of up to 12
feet throughout the day.
       The storm=0F's first winds cut power and telephone service to many h=
omes
in St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The hurricane ripped up trees and
unleashed a steady rain that flooded large areas.
       The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent medical teams to
the Virgin Islands ahead of the storm. The agency=0F's director, James Lee
Witt, told reporters that damage assessors would fly in today.
       He said that while the hurricane damaged roofs, including that of th=
e
national armory, he did not expect widespread damage because FEMA had helpe=
d
the government institute new hurricane building codes after Hurricane
Marilyn devastated the islands in 1995.
       The territory has a $1 billion debt and still owes $8 million for
federal disaster loans from Hurricane Marilyn and Hurricane Hugo in 1989.

RUINOUS WAVES
       Waves smashed over the 8-foot sea wall at Frederiksted, the
second-largest town on the island, tearing away the wooden pier that was th=
e
fish market and a small part of the concrete pier where cruise ships dock.
       In Christiansted, St. Croix=0F's main town, the boardwalk was submer=
ged,
and winds tore part of the roof off the newly renovated King Christian
Hotel.
       The storm beached and sunk boats from Aruba, off Venezuela=0F's coas=
t in
South America, to Grenada and St. Kitts.
       On St. Kitts=0F' concrete pier, a half dozen people suffered fractur=
es
and other injuries when they were hit by waves. Storm surges in Grenada
swept away four houses, washed away asphalt roads, damaged runway lights at
the airport and flooded roads and the business district.
       Turnbull said Wednesday he was waiting for President Clinton to
declare St. Croix a disaster area, making it eligible for federal emergency
funds.

I mentioned that I have been working on eStrategy.  I thought I would share 
with you my contributions.  The Word doc is a template that is partially 
filled in with my ideas (in blue).  Slides 6-8 are my attempt to condense my 
ideas into a couple of diagrams and e-Strategy statement.  I have worked 
primarily with Mike Sullivan on this but several others have played a 
reviewer role so far.  Of course, this is very preliminary but I thought you 
may find it interesting as you have always enjoyed technology.

		 Subject: Re: Confidentiality Agreement with Scana

Sara,
Sorry, I was too assiduous in deleting what I thought would be duplicated on 
this thread, so I'm working from memory on comments before Guenther's last 
contribution.

Data for pricing is owned by Enron Credit Ltd (generated by employees of 
Enron Power Operations Ltd whose costs are charged to ECL)
Information deals are done with ECL (Derivative transactions are currently 
with Enron North America Corp, probably with Enron Credit Inc in the future)
The Enron staff who would be looking at this are employed by Enron North 
America Corp which is why I suggested ENAC as the named party.
They clearly act for ECL on information deals.
If it's OK to use ECL then that would be easier for us.

I have no objections to suggestions that I should be promoted! In the 
meantime, I am a board director of ECL and have both legal and group 
management authority to sign contracts (with a lawyer's initials being a 
prerequisite).

Regards,
Richard

Guenther:

Thanks for the response.  I'll wait to hear from Richard Sage as to who owns 
the information.
Only officers at the VP level or higher may execute binding contracts for all 
Enron U.S. companies (bylaws).  I do not know the ""rule"" for non-U.S. 
companies (although I suspect the articles of association would contain that 
information).

Sara

You are right about the tax issue - in fact, we are in the process of 
replacing the UK directors and officers of Enron Credit Inc with US directors 
and officers.

The entity that signs up to the confidentiality agreement ought to be the one 
that owns the information to be supplied.  Based on conversations I have had 
with Richard Sage, I had formed the impression that the owner of the 
information was Enron Credit Ltd.  If this is right, we should pursue your 
first suggestion.  Otherwise, given that the tax issue is being rectified and 
this should therefore be an isolated incident, I think we can wear the tax 
risk inherent in your second suggestion.  Though I do wonder whether an 
officer of Enron Credit Inc, such as Richard Sage (currently), could sign, 
rather than a director?

Kind regards

Guenther Klar

That's when the deal was done apparently.  I don't care when I get the gas as
long as it's before the month's over.  I guess you didn't know about it??

		 Subject: IMPORTANT CONFERENCE CALL ON QF/SRAC MATTERS SCHEDULED FOR 12:30 
P.M. (NOONISH) ON SUNDAY, JAN.  21

An important conference call is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, 
Today, Jan 21 to discuss the status of legislative meetings on QF/SRAC 
matters.  
 
Call-In number is            888-422-7124
Particpant Code is          111756
 
 
Status Report
After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF 
Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored ""deal"" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this 
morning.  The crux of the deal is as follows:
 
For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years [""all in"", i.e. includes 
capacity and energy]
1.0 on losses
no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity 
obligations in the past
Applies ""going forward"" (presumedly Feb. 1)
 
 
For gas-fired QFs...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;  payment will 
increase/decrease tied to gas  (this assumes an IER of 9821)
1.0 on line losses
applies ""going forward""
Caacity True-up and ""forbearance"" were not addressed.  Credit worthiness will 
be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).  
This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, 
followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.  This is 
essentially the PG&E/QF ""deal"" for the gas guys.  For the renewables, it is 
more of a fixed payment approach.
 
A ""Technical Conference"" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to 
work out some of the implementing details."
0,"El Paso announced changes to its pipeline cleaning and internal inspection 
program. Line 1100 between Eunice and Pecos River Stations will be smart 
pigged Sunday (postponed one day), causing a 200 MMcf/d flow reduction 
through Eunice to the South Mainline. Six interconnects will not be able to 
deliver into El Paso for 10 hours that day. Another smart pigging of Line 
1100 between Pecos River and Guadalupe Stations will occur Nov. 22 (also 
postponed one day), requiring a reduction of 200 MMcf/d through Pecos River. 
Line 1203 (Maricopa Line) pigging will be done Nov. 21-24, reducing the 
line's capacity by 60 MMcf/d and affecting deliveries of San Juan gas to the 
Phoenix area. Line 3222 pigging will be done Nov. 30 and Dec. 19, causing a 
100 MMcf/d allocation. Line 3201 pigging will be done Dec. 2 and 20, causing 
a 150 MMcf/d allocation. The allocations will affect points upstream of 
Bondad Mainline and Gallup. "

Is it to late to change the Home Depot article. The issue with the county has
been resolved

Here is a revised version

""The developer of the Home Depot/ Target Center on FM2094 is proceeding on
plan.

The developers have requested that the Texas Department of Transportation
modify the new FM 2094 road to include three left turn lanes and a light at
Miller Road. The Water District has agreed to also include the new center in
their district as long as they pay any extra costs and meet certain other
conditions. The Developers have agreed to pay the extra cost for both
requests. The City passed a resolution to support both requests by the
developer and to express our intention to annex the property once the
developer closes on the property and makes an annexation request of the City.

The County and the Developers have also agreed to share in resurfacing part,
about 2100 feet, of Hanson Road- - a $200,000 cost. This is a significant
expense on top of all the other cost mentioned above.

But the project is proceeding as planned. The developers are still planning
on closing on the property in the next few weeks.""

Prebon sent over a confirm for off-peak hours and then sent a revision to 
peak hours.  Which one is it?"
0,"FYI.  Appears that the Davis administration has thrown down the gauntlet, 
looking to position itself in a way that will allow it to blame the FERC/Bush 
administration for California's electricity crisis, unless FERC agrees to the 
ISO's price cap plan.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: FW: CAISO Notice - Draft Market Stabilization Plan


Greetings:
Late last night the ISO released a Market Stabilization plan that would
essentially impose cost based pricing control caps and apply a strict
California First Policy.

Here's ISO's 3-page sketch to impose cost-based pricing intended to control
costs on consumers on very short order.  Unit-specific cost-based bid caps
will apply to ISO markets.  ISO will have dispatch control over all CA
generation.  Capital costs and return appear to be excluded from the bid
caps.  ISO will pick of the day-ahead and day-of energy markets lot to the
demise of CalPX, thus ending the ""market separation.""  There appears to be
language that intimates direct unit dispatch, but the document is very thin
on this. ISO proposes payments based either on the ""as-bid"" up to unit bid
cap, or apparently a uniform market-clearing price based on marginal units
cap.  Out of state resources are paid California capped rates.  Settlement
will be on numbers other than those posted (so much for transparency).
There's looking to procure AS based on optimization, although this is not
spelled out well (it appears that self-provision is gummed up completely).

To prevent ""MW Laundering"" CA will required in-area generation to make all
capacity
available whenever Stage 1 or higher emergency (i.e., reserves below 7%).
This California
First! rule means the generation must be scheduled against CA loads or bid
into day-ahead
market.  If you don't bid your bid cap is applied.  There will be a capacity
element
similar to RMR.  This change will require FERC buy-in, which obviously will
be
litigation-central, and its likely to create a cascade of similar
requirements from other
states ...

Thanks Andy for the quick summary!

IEP will monitor the Friday call and review all documents to let people know
what is happening.

Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the HPL Liquids contract

Vince,

Sounds good!  It will take two or three days for me to strip out, reformat, 
and assemble the Kaminski columns(since we didn't do this last year, I'm 
guessing you mean all columns since the beginning), so I envision us being 
ready with the completed set the first part of next week.  I assume that you 
would like me to omit those people who have moved on?

Also,  on page three of the first volume, you had written an introduction.  I 
have updated  the content for volume two, but would you perhaps like to do a 
new one?

0,"Davis' criticism of Texas misdirected, report finds 
Lynda Gledhill, Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff Writers
Tuesday, July 10, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

N48875.DTL 
Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of 
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power 
crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share 
of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of 
California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private 
energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the 
state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting 
to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting 
against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and 
simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most 
of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying 
the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators 
who have also gouged California. 
""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across 
their face because they are robbing us blind,"" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state 
Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from 
Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are 
made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually 
used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most 
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and 
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped 
as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events 
that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover 
from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in 
receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, 
an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents 
subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged 
market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, 
received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged 
higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 
million.

prices are driving up consumer bills and state regulators look at options for 
unbundling Southern California Gas Co.'s transmission and storage system. 
According to other state energy officials he talks with, Richard Bilas, 
commissioner at the California Public Utilities Commission, said, ""We could 
have some real problems."" Bilas, the former energy commissioner and 
immediate-past president of the CPUC, has proposed a modest unbundling of 
SoCalGas' system, given the current energy price volatility, in a proposed 
settlement decision now being reviewed. Action on the proposed decision could 
come Dec. 21, but observers predict alternate orders will be offered by some 
of Bilas's colleagues on the five-member CPUC, and that could push into next 
year final action. 
If gas prices continue at their precedent-setting levels, California likely 
will be intervening at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as it already 
has been doing regarding last summer's electricity price spikes, Bilas said. 
""There are a lot of things the state can do, but whether they are done is a 
matter of philosophical and political judgment,"" he said. ""If gas prices get 
totally out whack in the view of a number of state decision-makers, there is 
likely to be intervention on behalf of the state into gas pricing. And I 
don't know if any of that serves the public well in the long run, but this is 
a short-run political problem."" 
As for his proposed decision on settlement for the unbundling of the 
SoCalGas's system, Bilas is unsure at this point if it will stimulate a more 
robust core aggregation market --- now almost a decade old --- with added 
volumes and marketers. He said he needs to hear from participants in the 
market in response to the proposed decision, which basically adopts the more 
modest compromise of three different settlements filed with the CPUC. 
""I'll know better where this proposed decision is going in another two weeks 
after I have talked with the other commissioners and some of the parties,"" 
said Bilas, noting that the pending gas settlements should be the last major 
changes in California's gas market for awhile, unless the state legislature 
decides to get involved as it has on several occasions in the past three 
years. 
""Everything to do with gas matters statewide is on the table and I am not 
going to make any predictions,"" Bilas said during a telephone interview in 
which he expressed concerns about both natural gas and electricity issues in 
California in the coming year. He said the supply-demand imbalance for the 
state's electricity market needs long-term solutions, but he thinks 
short-term political answers will win out. 
Bilas said the recent state energy commission conclusion that California's 
electricity needs can be met with the existing plants underway or proposed 
could pan out, but only if an unlikely combination of three factors converge: 
all the plants now on the drawing board actually get built, no major electric 
or gas transmission bottlenecks occur, and energy prices stabilize. 
""Even if all of the proposed plants came on line in two years rather than 
three, I think we still would have problems,"" he said. ""Let's face it, demand 
for electricity in the Pacific Northwest and California is growing like 
crazy. So, until there is something done on the demand side, so we get some 
demand responsiveness, just attacking the supply side I don't think is going 
to do it."" "

that there is more opportunity than risk in this for us.  Price volatility is 
in the news like never before and our main product is price risk management.  
I know that the inquiries are up, I hope EES and ENA can get some sales out 
of it.  More utilities have been approaching TNPC, EES and ENA about taking 
over their merchant functions.  On the policy side, we are working the issue 
on both a state and federal level.  Whether this country does anything 
meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda 
Breathitt.  Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about 
proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC.  We are working the RTO process 
hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our 
remaining allies around the country.   THis is the biggest time for us on 
this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire.  In the 
current panic, however, we will be decimated if we are associated only with a 
move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona).  
I am going to read the comments next, but I start off thinking we need to 
avoid running headlong into the price cap movement; we may be better off 
trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.

Subject: Azurix

Stan, 
Today is Diane Bazelides' last day of work at Azurix. Over the last month, 
Diane and I have met several times to transition the Azurix Public Relations 
function into ETS. Shelley and I also met with John Garrison. As you know, 
Azurix has a lot of irons in the fire and many of them could turn into public 
relations challenges. 
Azurix has PR employees in Buenos Aires, Ontario, and California. These 
employees were notified by Diane that I was taking over the Azurix PR 
function and to coordinate their activity through me. I've spoken to a few of 
the PR employees.
To summarize what Azurix might face in the near future, here's what Diane and 
John provided me and Shelley: 
? Offers to purchase Azurix North America are due May 24. John anticipates 
spending one month reveiwing the offers and making management presentations. 
As a deal is done and made public, information and responses to the media 
will be coordinated with Mark Hudson in Ontario. 
? The Madera project in California continues. Cole Frates is on the ground in 
California and I will coordinate with Cole as issues surface. 
? Gustavo Pedace is on the ground in Buenos Aires. If I had to guess, this is 
where Azurix has the most exposure. As July and August approach, we'll know 
more about the direction of Azurix Buenos Aires. 
? As things transpire with the other assets, I'll coordinate PR activity with 
the contacts on the ground. Mark Palmer and his staff know that ETS is 
involved in Azurix. 
I have a phone call into John Shafer to discuss the use of the crisis center 
in case of an Azurix emergency. This is a precautionary measure that I hope 
we don't have to use.
Please let me know if you would like to discuss Azurix and the PR function 
further.

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

In response to the below, there was a short planning meeting between 
Commercial Support and IT, specific objectives were identified which would 
enhance the DPR and reporting process, and improve the robustness of our 
processes, the following has been agreed in principle:

1. Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, 
pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.
2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be 
signed off by risk management before end of day.
3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a 
comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's 
portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to 
be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )
4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be 
reported to technical support in the event of a failure.  

The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time 
for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning 
of the next trading day.

Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each 
business area/valuation system for the following:
a) current state
b) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking
c) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - 
Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - 
implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )

Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full 
commercial signoff

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of

would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the

		 Subject: California Update 3/06/01


Executive Summary
? If no comprehensive deal is reached by April 9th, chances of bankruptcy 
increase due to a one day ""opt-out"" clause in all long-term power contracts. 
? PG&E and State locked in tough negotiations, several issues on the table:
 PUC-imposed requirement forcing PG&E to ultimately be responsible for 
California energy supplies
 Price of the grid; state - 2.3 times book value vs. PG&E - 4 times book value
? PG&E will not use any of the $1B secured last week to help their ailing 
utility.
? Davis's announcement of long term power contract didn't include some 
details:
 Of the 8,800 megawatts secured this far, only 6,000 are available this 
summer 
 Some of the ""long term contracts"" are really only for three months
 None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot 
market
? One the same day Davis announced long term contracts, Davis also quietly 
announce a 10% rate hike.
? FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal.
 
PG&E
Transmissions deal
One thing that is still uncertain is PG&E.  Bankruptcy may still be a likely 
alternative if current negotiations to buy PG&E's share of the electric 
transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April 9 (when all long-term power 
contracts being negotiated have a one-day ""opt-out"" clause they can exercise 
unilaterally if a ""comprehensive solution"" has not been reached by the state 
and its major utilities).  According to sources close to senior PG&E 
officials, PG&E made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal 
on the transmission lines depends on the California government's willingness 
to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make 
until now. 

PG&E will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to 
relieve it of the PUC-imposed requirement to be the ""electricity buyer of 
last resort.""  Current state regulations make the utility companies 
ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all 
times to supply California's energy needs.  As long as the state steps in and 
makes those purchases, as it has for the past three months, the utilities are 
shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot 
market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings.  
But, PG&E officials are worried 1) this summer's supply and 2) Davis's 
concern over how fast he is draining the state's budget surplus.  If things 
get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state 
will pay only for the electricity it buys through long-term contracts, then 
PG&E will be left holding the bag. 

Thus, as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid, PG&E is 
demanding a ""comprehensive solution"" that includes not being liable for cost 
differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed 
to pay.  State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of ""get out of 
jail free"" card, so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough 
negotiations that are complicated by three other factors: (1) PG&E's public 
behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to 
encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy; (2) State legislative 
demands that the price Davis negotiate for PG&E's part of the electricity 
grid be no more than 2.3 times revenues from the grid; and (3) the FERC must 
""positively approve"" any grid purchase by the state of California. 

The principal concern on the price front is that PG&E wants to sell the 
electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their 
transmission, while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the 
politically acceptable limit.  ""We see 2.3 times book value as an absolute 
upper bound. There is no way PG&E will get more than that, whatever they 
think,"" according to the leader of one main consumer groups.  ""We are going 
to try to force any deals down to about 2.0 in any case."" Negotiators for 
Davis are also trying to 'proposition-proof' any transmission deal to protect 
against a later ballot proposal.  They think there are ways to do that, but 
not if the price of PG&E's part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative.  
Remember, if Davis's eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative, he will 
be running for re-election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed 
to overturn his solution.

On the Sacramento front - no one understands PG&E's motives
The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game 
PG&E is playing.  In a three day period PG&E made a series of announcements 
that left everyone scratching their heads. 
? Late Thursday, PG&E officials leaked information to California papers that 
they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity 
transmission grid to the state, which seemed like obvious good news, but then 
made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30% 
above what the state was currently offering.  While a deal can still be done, 
anything like the $10 billion PG&E wants would be very hard to get through 
the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase. 
? Late Friday, PG&E officials announced that they had secured a $1 billion 
loan for the parent company (not the electricity utility) and would use the 
money to pay off bondholders, other creditors and to return $161 million to 
shareholders in a new dividend payout.  Not a cent of that money was 
earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PG&E and that left at 
least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the 
utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood. 
? Over the weekend, PG&E leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay 
off its energy suppliers' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now.  For 
generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to 
start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy 
action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will 
""make them whole"" in a couple of months, that kind of trial balloon is 
extremely unnerving.

Thus, in a very short time period, PG&E's corporate owners showed they could 
access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they 
were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the 
energy crisis.  Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at 
least a part of the $13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer 
and PG&E's fund-raising will harden and deepen those demands.  As one senior 
political official told our source ""just when you think the corporate 
leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible, they 
come up with something even more outrageous."" 

PG&E's actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to 
construct to solve California's problems.  State Democrats doubt they will 
get Republican support for a deal, which means a vote will fall short of the 
two-thirds majority necessary for immediate enactment (resulting in 90 days 
for the legislation to go into effect).  Additionally, in the past 48 hours, 
many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less 
in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and 
may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the 
electricity grid.

Long-term Contracts - Davis didn't tell the whole truth
Yesterday, Davis announced that he had signed ""long-term"" power deals for 
8,800 megawatts of power, out of a total 12,000 megawatts he wanted to sign 
eventually. According to the press release, Davis is now 75% of the way 
toward his long-term goal and has already solved the hardest part of 
California's energy crisis. This means consumers would maybe pay more than 
necessary five years from now, but these contracts ""guaranteed"" that 
consumers would pay less for the next three years.  What Davis failed to 
highlight was that of the 8,800 megawatt commitment, actually only 6,000 
megawatts are available this summer (when demand is expected to 45,000 
megawatts); and some of these ""long-term contracts"" are actually only good 
for three months.  None of these contracts, however, keep California from 
having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market.

Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year
While the media was concern with Davis's announcement of long term contracts 
for California, of less concern to the media was Davis's quietly announced a 
decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers. The state will 
accept the 10% emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a 
permanent increase as well as an additional 10% increase for consumers that 
will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires. 
That would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour. 

FERC
The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve 
it in a positive vote. Senior California officials and legislators doubt that 
FERC has jurisdiction, and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal. But 
they may be wrong. ""The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs 
off on the deal. Its power over transmission deal is absolute, no matter what 
anyone says,"" according to source close to the President. There are three 
possibilities: 1) FERC could ""pocket veto"" it by not even putting it on 
agenda for discussion; 2) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted 
down. The Democrat on the commission, William Massey, has already said he is 
opposed to it; or 3) the Commission could approve it but with condition that 
Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system.

One complicating factor in the FERC decision, however, is that its chairman 
Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale, may not 
be around long enough to have his say. ""Hebert is definitely not a shoo in 
for the FERC chairman position,"" says one Washington official. Two other 
appointments to the Commission will soon be named, this official notes, and 
one of them ""could easily become chairman.""

SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY 
REGULATION 





Senators Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and Jean Carnahan, D-Mo., have asked the 
General Accounting Office (GAO) to inquire into whether the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC) is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure 
that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and 
that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to 
customers. ""Under federal law, FERC has the responsibility to ensure just
and 
reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission,"" the Senators said 
in a letter to GAO, ""but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have 
fulfilled this role in the California situation."" Following is text of the 
letter: 

April 12, 2001 

Mr. David M. Walker 
Comptroller General of the United States 
U.S. General Accounting Office 
441 G Street, N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20548 

Dear Mr. Walker: 

We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers
sporadic 
rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout

the western United States, a situation that may get worse this summer when 
the demand for electricity increases. We understand that there are many 
factors that have contributed to the current situation, and few short term 
options to create more electricity for this market. At the same time we are 
extremely troubled that California's Independent System Operator (ISO) 
recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly

been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the 
electricity, an overcharge amounting to $6.8 billion according to the 
operator. Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a 
non-functioning market that has, in turn, exacerbated the state's
electricity 
shortage.With the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in 
additional states such as Missouri, we are concerned whether there is 
adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power 
by suppliers. Without such oversight, the nation may not progress towards 
achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation: lower consumer 
prices, greater reliability, increased choice, and more efficient
generation. 
Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the 
oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission (PSC), which

works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity 
or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates, to the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under federal law, FERC has the 
responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale

transmission, but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have
fulfilled 
this role in the California situation. FERC Commissioner William Massey 
recently said: ""Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets 
requires that we clearly define market power, and aggressively intervene
when 
the markets are not producing reasonable prices. The commission's actions to

date have been insufficient."" (March 20, 2001 testimony to the House Energy 
Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Air quality).We are requesting that 
the General Accounting Office (GAO) assess whether FERC is properly 
exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates. Specifically,
we 
ask GAO to answer the following questions: 

1) Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates? Is 
FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its
statutes 
power supply, demand, and pricing in California? In other Western states? In

the Central Midwest and in the Northeast? 

2) Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight 
obligations in a timely and effective manner? And does FERC have the 
necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role? 

3) Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring 
just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now

occurring in so many states? 

4) As we understand the situation from some experts, the number of 
transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market 
place is voluminous. This situation may increase the difficulties of
guarding 
against market abuse. Is there a role for another agency or independent 
organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these 
transactions? If so, what would be an appropriate oversight role? 

5) We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices 
relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market 
would help guard against market abuses. We understand the need to keep
prices 
confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion. After this 
appropriate period of time has passed, would greater transparency be 
beneficial? 

We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public 
Utility Commission (CPUC) that market power has been abused in the 
transmission of natural gas, which has in turn contributed to the spiraling 
cost of electricity generation in the state. The CPUC maintains that the 
price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been
manipulated 
so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times 
the national average. Because an increasing number of states, including 
California, rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants, any manipulation

of that commodity can have severe consequences. Additionally, because such a

large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural 
gas, we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have 
even more profound effects. Therefore, we ask GAO to answer the following 
questions: 

1) Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate

pipelines? If not, what areas require improvement? 

2) Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to 
the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines? Should
this 
role be enhanced or clarified, and if so, how? 

3) Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other
parts 
of the country, aside from California, where the natural gas pipeline 
capacity is similarly limited? Please provide any details.We appreciate all 
the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Sincerely,J

each said they agreed to give the parties a chance to work it out in the

Hi All,
For those of you that don't know I am currently on a 7 week trip through
Africa, from Nairobi to Vic Falls, with my brother John-Henry. This will be
our means of updating all you boring non-traveller types of our adventures.
We arrived yesterday safe and well in Nairobi. We were tired, but had a full

day visiting an animal orphanage that raised these animals and set them back

into the wild. We were very priviledged to pet baby elephants, rhino and
zebra. We had a meeting of the folks we are travelling with and they all
seem really nice. All in their early 20's and I think I am mingling in well.

There are 8 of us on a truck made for 20 so lots of room. Last night we went

to a carvery that specialised in the local wildlife. Crocs, Zebra, antelope
that sort of thing. Today has been a long drive into Tanzania, to a place
called Arusha, from here we go off on a 3 day game drive over the serengeti.

We are staying in a place called Snakepark, which is a little unnerving, but

hell thats what we are here for.
We are both fit, well, happy and a little pink. I gave the first of those
little toys out today mum, there was a ?3yr old when we stopped for
charcoal. It took her a few minutes to touch the wiggling frog, but she
loved it. I had to bribe the others with pens so they didn't snatch it off
her. We are off now to eat as we skipped lunch and it is about 4.30pm.
Love to you all
Tessa and J-H

Hey Folks,

How is old blightey!!!
What a week J-H and I have had.
The 3 day safari around the Serengetti and Ngorongoro Crater was fantastic.
The 8 of us were split between 2 landrovers, that the rooves came off so we
had a really good view. We saw loads of game, basically everything. I was
most impressed with the 7 rhino - ok so 6 of them were in the distance and
we only knew they were rhino by looking through nans fantastic binoculars, a

quick thankyou to nan for lending them to me. And 6 cheetahs as I had seen
niether on my previous safari. Other things included 2 eagles eating an
impala up a tree, a leopard must have killed it and taken it up there, we
sat and watched a very bossy male zebra organising this whole herd of zebra
in and out of a watering hole in groups. Also elephant, lions - lots,
especially 11 sat on a large rock together, hippos, hyena, wildebeast,
warthogs, waterbuffalow, crocodile. I have probably left loads out, but you
get the drift, J-H made a list. In the evenings we camped and you will all
get to here J-h's story of the lion, but it is his story - niether lion nor
boy were harmed.
I will have to finish this tomorrow as I have loads more to say, but I have
to meet my group for a sunset beer.
Thanks Mandy for passing all this on. Give mum our love and reassure her
that J-H is really coming into his own.
Ross- don't you dare start lecturing me about settling down, you are only
doing it now and you are a dinosaur compared to me.

Love you all loads, and thanks for the replies.

Tessa

Ok Folks,
Where was I?
If you are interested we just made sunset last night and had a very welcome
cold beer.
Back to the adventure! The campsites we say in vary hugely, we range from
ones with just a hole in the ground toilet facility - like the one in the
Serengetti, to ones with proper toilets, showers with warmish water and
fully stocked bars!! In the Serengetti we were very close to nature. Too
close, we all went to bed early - this seems to be a bit of a trend, bed
before 10 most nights and up at 6, we have even made it up before sunrise a
few times. But the stories going between tents in the serengetti were of the

campers that have been lost to lions. Sure enough we certainly saw evidence
of their presence in the camp when we got up in the morning, even without
J-H's story. The next night after a long game drive, we camped on the edge
of the Ngorongoro crater, a bit windy, but warm, then as soon as the sun
went down it was bitterly cold and we huddled round the fire to eat our
supper, but all retreated to our sleeping bags soon after. It actually
turned out to be the best night sleep some of us had, especially as I always

find a lumpy bit of ground. I share a tent with a girl from Huddersfield
called Helen and we have the putting up and dismantling of the tent down to
a fine art.
The crater was fantastic, very bumpy and we were being thrown around the
back of the landrover as the driver did his best to get in front of a Rhino,

he did a brilliant job and it meant that the rhino passed by really closely.

That evening we went back to the snake park, to find our intrepid leaders
had finished doing some work on the truck. We were all desperate for
showers, even though you get dusty and mucky again very quickly it is lovely

for a while. We tried our best to wash our clothes, and managed to get the
semi clean. Since then Helen and I have discovered that it is easier to pay
a local to clean them properly and it only costs 15p for a pair of trousers.
The next day we played with the snakes for a while in the morning, they have

a baby pyhton we are allowed to hold, then J-H had a ride on a camel.
We went into Arusha to do a few things and stayed at a campsite the other
side of town, just to knock 20mins of the journey the next day. The cooking
has become a bit of a competition, J-H and I did the first dinner, rice and
stir fried veggies. Everyone thought it was great and it set a challenge for

the others, so people get a bit worried before its their turn. Since we did
just veggies, people have been adding meats, doing selection of salads,
cooking the rice with cashew nuts. It is getting like Ready Steady Cook,
when they started the chefs only did maincourses, now they do 5 course
dinners!!
We started the next day at 4.30am, it is a long drive from Arusha to Dar Es
Salaam, but we got to see the best sunrise over mount Kilimanjaro. During
these drives we are very pleased to be a select group, cos it means we get
to spread out and sleep. When we don't sleep it is really interesting to
watch the world go by and wave at the locals. They must be used to seeing
the trucks as quite a few do the same route, ours is the scruffiest - we are

very proud.
The campsite in Dar was right on the beach, we all ran in fora swim mand
gave up after we were over 100 yards in and syill only knee deep.
We had a morning in Dar and took the afternoon ferry over to Zanzibar. We
all fell deeply in love, it is the most beautiful place. We are staying in a

hotel here, Helen and I were in raptures over the ensuite bathroom and
airconditioning. We showered quickly and went off for dinner. In Stone Town
there is an evening market that is mainly selling cooked food, so you wander

down and take your pick. The first night I had tuna, squid and lobster, to
give you and idea, the lobster cost me about 80p. The group decided there
and then that we are setting up a commune here and turning our back on
civilisation.
Anywhere I can dine nightly on lobster gets my vote. We went on a spice tour

of the island yesterday, they grow everything from nutmeg to chilli to
cumerin. And all the fruit, bannanas, star fruit, mangos, pineapple, apples,

lemons etc etc, eat home even has their own tree that produces iodine for
any cuts they may get.
Obviously we went back to the market for dinner, J-H has challenged himself
to try and eat 5000 shillings worth - about 4 pounds, so far he is up to
3000. Today is a lazy day, postcards will be written etc. Tomorrow we are
off to stay at a deserted beach on the east of the island. This has been a
long e-mail - mainly for the family - cause the internet places will be few
and far between when we hit Malawi next week, so you may not here from us
for a week or 2. We will try whenever we can.
Love to all in breezy old England
Tessa

Dear All,

This is our last day in Zanzibar. We have just come back from the East
coast. It was very pretty, with few tourists or hotels. Unfortunately this
made the food and drinks more exspensive - ok, so we may only be talking
about 8p, but we are in cheap-sake travelling mood. There was also not a lot

to do, so it was 2 days of lying in the shade - the sun being too hot -
reading, playing cards and looking for shells on the beach. Boy what a tough

life I have!!
Our swahili is up to about 8 or so words.
Jambo - hello
Habari - how are you
Mizuri - beautiful
Mizuri-sana - very beautiful
Santa-sana - thankyou very much
Karibu - welcome
Fiti-Fiti - slang for very well
Thats about it.
Today we went to swim with the dolphins on the south coast. Apparently
nobody informed the dolphins and only a couple of pods turned up and they
were not in the playing mood. We got quite close to them and as soon as
anyone jumped into the water they were off - honestly you just can't get the

dolphins!!
Then we snorkelled on the reef for a while, there seemed to be quite a bit
of damage. I was really annoyed by a fella that kept diving underneath me
and picking things off the coral. Some people are sooo ignorant - sorry
Ulli, I love you to pieces - but they were bloody Germans.
We have our last meal at the harbour stalls tonight and take the 10pm ferry
back to Dar. Because of some silly rule they won't let us into Dar until
6am, so we kip on board ship.
Then we are back to our wonderfully dusty old truck and more bush camps.
As I said before Malawi is very poor and unlikely to have lots of internet
cafes so it may be a week or 2 before the next one.

Loads of Love
Tessa

Dear All,

Welcome back mum and dad, hope India was fab. The gang over here think the
Weltons are trying to take over the world.
Well, it has been a long time since the last update. This is due to Malawi
being a very friendly but poor country.
The adventures in the last 9 days are too much to go into too much detail.
The partying started in ernest at Lake Malawi, up until then the driver
thought we were a little slow, I was up late, but everyone else was flaking.

Our first big night the weltons did well, winning a drinking game each and
not being any of the 3 people that passed out. The next big night a few days

later we didn't do so well, the other boys think it is very amusing to get
J-H plastered and they have found 2 drinking games that he is really bad at.

He has even started praticing on the truck as we travel around. That night
though was a bad taste night and we had all had a budget and went to a
clothes market and bought each other outfits. Everyone was hoping I looked
bad, but a very nice unimaginative bloke just bought me an overall, I was
disappointed. All the lads had frocks, J-H had a fetching orange silky
blouse and silky skirt, he looked surprisingly fetching. Slightly less so
when passed out on the toilets 3 hrs later, or passed out on the floor in
front of the toilets, and he annoyed a few people when he woke up at 4.30 am

demanding to know where the party was - loudly. Apart from the parties we
have seen and done other things we have visited a school, a hospital, a
mountain or 2, had a tribal village meal and a brewery. That last one was
really tough. The gang are getting on really well, some how a hitch-hiker
has joined us, but he's cool. We had a couple of days of heavy rain, so
people were getting fed up with the tents, the mozzies have been on great
form, but its Africa and we love it. The crew have been trying to persuade
us to stay till Cape Town and if I didn't have fixed plans I would be here a

few more months. I shall return.
Now we are in Harare the capital of Zim. Just to make any of you sports
lovers sick, we have found out where the England cricket team are and will
be going to their hotel to watch the 6-nations rugby this pm and supporting
them in their one day against Zim tomorrow. As I said its a hard life. Last
night we went to a local night club and the band were amazing and still
going when we left at 3.30 am. I have just enough time to do a spot of
shopping before going to find Goughie and the boys.
I have probably left loads out, but nevermind, you are all going to have to
listen to my stories anyway.

Hoyt and Melissa,

I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort 
of services for MG/RW.  It looks like there may be some key personnel we want 
to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.   I am not 
really familiar with the specific facts here.

The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract 
personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their 
activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and 
other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  So, if the plan is 
to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an 
employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a 
supervisor.  Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.

If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers 
-- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.    It 
is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting 
agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other 
alternative).  Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people 
who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk 
of the contract workers.

I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a 
definitive conclusion.  So, let's try to discuss it.  I am booked until about 
11 this morning, but am available after that.

Subject: Priviliged and Confidential communication to my attorney Re: Henry 
Bath LA  

Melissa, my concern is that we may get hit with what is called a 
""co-employment suit"" in the US.  This is where an agency employee claims that 
he/she was treated like an employee, therefore he/she should get employee 
benefits (vs. benefits from the agency company, which are probably weak).  
Since we did a share purchase of MG, if the agency employees filed a suit 
against MG claiming that they are really employees, I think that we would 
have to defend it.

I am not an attorney, but I am going to send this to Michelle Cash, who can 
advise us on the position we should take.  I would think that if we single 
out certain employees to become Enron employees and the remainder stay as 
agency employees, this would enhance the legal position of the agency 
employees (versus everyone staying as an agency employee).  Michelle, can you 
help us with this one?  Thanks.

Melissa, I also think we should minimize distribution on this discussion . .

Subject: Henry Bath LA

Hi Hoyt,

I have today spoken to Ed Dablin regarding Henry Bath LA.  We discussed how 
the employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees, although they are 
infact agency workers.  Ed confirmed that Martha and half a dozen other 
employees quite clearly should become Enron employees and should get 
applicable benefits.

The other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should 
become Enron employees and should remain as agency staff.

He realises that the original granting of Share Options has slightly ""muddied 
the water"" with regard to whether these employees are employees of Enron or 
the agency.  He was not involved with the original decision to grant these 
employees Share Options.

We discussed the issues (in broad terms, as I could not remember all of the 
specific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals 
Enron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy 
thing to do.  

However, this is his ideal scenario.  How viable is it that we can do this 
for him?

He also made the point that Martha is the most senior executive in Henry Bath 
Inc. and is one of his most valuable employees.

Regards

Melissa

When he emerged in the mid-1980s at the dawn of new traditionalism, Lyle Lovett had more than a craggy visage to set him apart. His subtle wit, sly humor, and Texas-sized musical eclecticism made him a force. Built around 13 songs from his first three albums, this compendium resoundingly affirms those gifts. One hears his musical metamorphosis from the beginning, through the stomping blues of ""Why I Don't Know,"" the honky-tonk talking blues ""Give Back My Heart,"" and the folkier ""L.A. County"" and...

0,"The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces."

Per Christi's thoughts, we may want to gauge Congressional interest in 
pushing something as an add-on to EPAct '92 that allows only safety / public 
interest reasons for an EWG to be restricted in its siting by a State.

I talked with Dan briefly about this to verify my conclusion that FERC would 
not get involved at this point.  The Florida issue seems similar to 
California (or any other state that has idiosyncratic siting issues) in that 
FERC has encouraged California to speed the siting of generation, but has not 
ordered it.  What I am not sure about is whether the possible DOE or 
Congressional emergency electricity legislation that Jim sent out yesterday 
(on demand side management payments) could also include language that would 
allow the federal government to override the certain state generation siting 
issues, such as the Florida law.

Christi, the Florida certificate process controls siting and licensing of 
generators.  Both are topics over which FERC has no authority.   
Consequently, FERC would have no authority to override the state.

Marchris --

Some things on follow-up from Ken Lay's call with Jeb Bush (could you have
answers by End of Week) -

1.   What is the process post the FL Supreme Court decision.  Did anyone
appeal to the Federal Courts?  Outcome of that action, if taken?

2.   Is it possible for the FERC to simply act to waive the CCN need?  Did
we ever discuss with FERC counsel the ability for that agency to ""override""
the CCN for any filing EWG?  What would they need to do?  Would FERC need
to take on the FPSC or Fla Supreme Court?  A state should have the right to
worry about safety and reliability, but not interfere with wholesale
competition.

3.   Have we calculated a ""back of the envelope"" $ value for the margin the
Utilities (FPL, TECO, FPC) will obtain by transferring generation at book?
I would think that nuke should be at book (this is a gimme) with the fossil
analyzed as the difference between average book ($/kw) and market value
($/kw - see Ben Jacoby).  What is the total $?

My understanding is that Steve Kean is heading into Florida to meet with
Sect of Environment next week.  We need to try and get a read from the
Utilities on how much $ would they be willing to give back in rate
decreases as a Generation Stranded Benefit to see this deal through before
the meeting.

Thanks,

Jim

approx. 3 oz of liquid had collected in the new filter separator in the PG&E 
C/S yard.  A request was made to analyze the liquid for not only PCB's but 
also pH to determine if the liquids resulted from the caustic and water 
cleaning of the upstream portion of the pipe leading into the PG&E C/S .  
This is the first occurance of liquids at this location since this new filter 
separator was installed and put inot service."

0,"That was always one of my favorites!  The old Parent Trap is always great 
too,  I wish that I could be there. I know that Brigeda must be excited about 
the slumber party.  When does she start school?  Today is day #2 for the 
girls --Amanda loves her classes.  Meagan thought that the first day 
""sucked"".  I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant 
principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her 
class selection.  Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she 
signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was 
thinking!!  Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive 
enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22 
deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and 
add a study hall.  She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars 
class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which is 
probably exactly what she needs.  I was prepared to go all the way to the 
school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but luckily 
I didn't have to go that far.  

Hope that you have a good weekend!  Love, sally

BRUSSELS, Aug. 21, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The European uncoated woodfree market remains quiet as the vacation period continues. But output curtailments have hit the headlines, as uncoated and coated woodfree producers kept taking downtime in the region during the second quarter.
Demand has not been anything to write home about this year, but the slack trend has been made worse by the mid-year vacation period when many offices are empty and order books thin. On top of the pressure to lower prices due to the lack of demand, suppliers have been faced with speculative buyers who are betting on uncoated woodfree paper prices falling further. As a result, buyers have been confining their purchases to minimum levels, replenishing stocks only when they need to.
Imports have perked up as those papermakers who have not been idling their machines have tried to find alternative markets for their products. One producer said large volumes of uncoated woodfree paper has been imported to Europe, especially from southeast Asia. Another supplier indicated that some Australian paper has found its way to the UK. 
Southern European papermakers have also reportedly been actively exporting to the Italian market. According to sources in Spain, the Spanish uncoated woodfree market is saturated due to overcapacity in the Iberian peninsula. 
Prices under pressure
The slack demand has pushed prices down in Europe over the vacation period, despite the heavy downtime taken. In the French market, prices for offset reels and sheets dropped by FF 100/tonne in June and by a further FF 100-300/tonne in July. One supplier said that business almost ground to a halt in July and that hefty discounts were available even on small orders. 
Germany has not escaped the price plunge either, with levels for offset sheets dropping DM 50/tonne at the top end of the range in June and DM 50/tonne at the bottom of the price band in July. Prices for offset reels dipped DM 100/tonne at the lower end in July. 
Italian levels for offset sheets and reels remained steady in June, but eroded by ITL 50/kg in July, while in the UK, both offset sheets and reels slid by Pounds 10/tonne in June and a further Pounds 10-20/tonne in July.
Cut-size crumbles
Copy paper managed to escape the price pressure on other uncoated woodfree grades for much of this year. But since June there have been signs that A4 is fallible, with levels starting to erode in almost all the major markets. 
Several players complained that Italy and Spain have been difficult markets, as some domestic producers have been running their machines flat out and selling as much as they can at low prices, benefiting from cheap spot pulp levels. Some suppliers to the Italian market said that the country's merchants have been aggressively trying to negotiate lower prices. 
Copy paper prices have slid by ITL 150/kg since April, and there have been reports of spot prices selling at ITL 200/kg below the market level. But one supplier was hopeful that the bottom has been reached and intends to try and raise prices by ITL 50/kg in September.
Cut-size levels remained steady in Germany. But in France, A4 prices have started to erode. Levels fell by FF 100/tonne at the bottom of the range in June and by another FF 100/tonne in July. 
In the UK, several industry insiders noted that the copy paper market has become more aggressive. Some suppliers reported that levels have been gradually eroding for the past couple of months, but others said they have not lowered their prices. On top of that, A4 from outside Europe, for example, from southeast Asia, is reportedly selling at up to Pounds 50/tonne below market levels.
But the outlook for the uncoated woodfree market is more positive for the rest of the year. Suppliers indicated that order books already look healthy for September, when activity traditionally perks up.

1,"Jay,

I wanted to send an e-mail to Imperial Sugar regarding the credit terms that 
we just talked about.  I wanted to run this e-mail by you first before I send 
it to  the customer.

Before entering into any trades, Imperial needs to post initial margin of 
$2MM with Enron.  Enron will continue to hold this cushion amount of margin 
as long as Imperial has any positions on with Enron.

Enron has the right to margin Imperial any time their MTM exposure to Enron 
exceeds $1.5MM.  We will margin in increments of $25,000.  If their exposure 
drops below $1.5MM we will return margin to them.  However, we will always 
maintain the cushion of $2MM.

Thanks,
Craig"

Dog Fight

George and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all.  They sat down 
and decided to settle the whole dispute with one big dog fight.  They agreed

that they would have five years to breed the best fighting  dogs in the 
world and whosever dog won would be entitled to dominate the world.

Osama and his dog handler Mohammed found the biggest, meanest Dobermans and 
Rottweilers in the world, then bred them with the biggest, meanest Siberian 
wolves they could find. From the litters, they selected the biggest and 
strongest puppy and trained it day and night to fight to the death.

After five years Osama and Mohammed came up with the biggest, meanest dog 
the world had ever seen.  It's cage needed steel bars that were five inches 
thick and nobody could get near it.

When the day came for the dog fight, George and his dog handler Boudreaux, 
showed up with a nine foot long Dachshund.  It was the strangest looking dog

anyone had ever seen.  Boudreaux said it was a Cajun Dachshund.

Everyone felt sorry for George and Boudreaux because they knew there was no 
way that this poor excuse for a dog could possibly last 10 seconds with 
Osama's big, mean animal.

When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund slowly came out of it's cage, 
wagged it's tail, then waddled over towards Osama's dog.

The Doberman/Rottweiler/Wolf snarled and leaped out of it's cage,then 
charged the poor Dachshund.  But when it got close enough to bite the 
Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened it's mouth and ate Osama's dog in one

bite. There was nothing left at all of the snarling beast.

Osama came up to George and Boudreaux shaking his head in disbelief.  ""We 
don't understand how this could have happened.  We had our best people 
working for five years with the biggest, meanest Dobermans and Rottweilers, 
and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves in the world.  How did you do this?""

""Da's easy"", said Boudreaux, the Cajun.  ""We 'ad our bess plasic surgins 
workin' fo' five year for to make dat alligator look like a weenie dog.""

Hi Charlotte,

We've been invited to someone's house for dinner on Feb 2.  Can you take
care of Michael?  The dinner is in River Oaks, so we could just drop him
off.

Michael  got a hair cut this weekend.  I think it makes him look taller.  I
wish it worked that way for me!  It is very short, and I think very cute.

We have learned the following from a talkative DTI rep:

DTI intends to  modify its existing 637 proposals.  Apparently, in light of 
customer opposition, DTI intends to withdraw its proposal to shorten the 
imbalance make-up period from 20 days to 72 hours and will instead develop a 
new rate schedule for electric generators, who it claims are the entities 
that drove DTI's need to shorten the make-up period in the first instance.

3,"Actually, I think the possibility of passage of the bill is relatively high 
as these things go. I don't think that the CFTC has much clout on Capitol 
Hill and now even less in light of the Treasury position.  We should work as 
hard as we can to get this done because another opportunity may not come 
along.  Obviously we will know more in September and a visit by you to 
Washington could be very helpful.

>>> <Mark.E.Haedicke@enron.com> 08/11 10:27 AM >>>

Do you think that a bill favorable to energy will be passed over the strong
opposition of the CFTC?  What kind of odds do you put on it?  It is a
significant change if Treasury is not longer against us -- but it is a little
hard for me to believe that it is real.  Should I try to make a trip to
Washington in September?  Let me know.

Hello Paul and Mark.  FYI:  CIG proposes to construct and operate facilities necessary to transport additional volumes of approximately 55 MDth per day of natural gas out of the Raton Basin Area in Colorado and New Mexico.  

The total cost of the project is $26,896,800  with a proposed rolled-in treatment for the expansion out of the Raton Basin Area.

Question - Do you all have any issues that you want us to address in regards to the expansion or will a plain vanilla intervention be fine?  The intervention is due Nov. 5th.

If you could get to me between now and the early part of next week, that would be great.

0,"Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. ""A"" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a ""must pass"" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is ""at least 
three years away from happening.""

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

Shalesh told me that his visited his HR screen some time ago and it showed a promotion to an Associate.

Any reason for that? It may be related to his transfer from EBS.

Vince,

As per our conversation yesterday I would very much appreciate it if you could help me with this matter.  I was under the impression that I would be promoted to Associate this August, which according to my pay stub and eHRonline hasn't occurred.  According to the A/A rules, a copy of which I am attaching below, an Analyst can be promoted to Associate if he/she falls under one of the criteria among several.  The one I believe I am eligible under states:

-  completed 2 years in the Program; have a performance rating of Excellent or above; and have either (1) an appropriate graduate degree or (2)  1 year of relevant commercial work experience prior to Enron

		 Subject: Angle Master Invention

Please have someone contact me at 425-503-4339 (cell telephone) or at the 
address on the web site underlined below  if 
Enron has an interest in the U.S. and internationally patented Angle Master. 
We now have marketing prototypes made, patents in place, outstanding consumer 
interest and are ready to proceed to the 
next step. 
The Angle Master can be very large or  small.. The output gear smoothly 
transitions from 0-90 degrees at high torque to 
to reach or drill any angle. The input gear can be driven by any device. No 
product on the market can perform 
like the Angle Master. I can see the use of the Angle Master for various 
drilling applications, including horizontal drilling 
Professional mechanics in all fields who have seen the smaller Angle Master 
all want one. We have endorsements from professional 
drivers, mechanics, and many others. 
A recently retired Captain of a nuclear aircraft carrier has stated in a 
letter ""....The use of the Angle Master.... will 
result in a significant time savings which in turn will increase combat 
readiness of aircraft and ships due to the more rapid 
turnaround of out of commission systems. Every mechanic will want the Angle 
Master in their toolbox after they have seen it in 
operation."" 
A Senior Vice President of Operations for a major Aerospace Company has 
stated in writing "" .... Prototype manufacturing, 
tool manufacturing, assembly, repair and overhaul operations will all benefit 
from the flexibility of the Angle Master."" 
The attached web page location underlined below is not yet completed, but it 
indicates just a few 
of thesmaller scale uses for the Angle Master. 
I look forward to hearing from you. 
  
Sincerely, 
  
Ed Szol

3,"Dear SVMG Member:

I need your help.

We will only limit the impact of this summer's Energy Crisis if all
Californian's make gigantic strides to reduce energy use.  With that in
mind, Governor Davis and the Legislature have passed the most aggressive
package of energy conservation incentives in the history of our Country.

Please note below a list of ways your employees - as residents - can save
money by saving energy.  I hope you will strongly consider relaying the
following e-mail message to all of your California employees.


SAVE MONEY BY SAVING POWER

As you know, California is in the midst of an Energy Crisis that is
threatening our state, the health and welfare of our citizens, and our
economy.  Fortunately, there are specific steps we can take - as businesses
and individual citizens - that can help us avoid rolling blackouts and their
devastating impacts this summer.

You may not be aware that Governor Davis and the California Legislature have
passed the most ambitious conservation incentive program in the history of
our nation.  This $1 billion package will help you - as a resident - to save
money while saving power.

Please note the information below to take advantage of these opportunities.
Along with the web site links below, please visit the Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group web site - www.svmg.org - for specific energy
conservation steps you can take at home and at work that will help save
power, save you money, and save our State's economy in the process.

Thank you for your help.

GOVERNOR'S RATE PROPOSAL:

The Governor's proposal is designed to accomplish multiple goals, including
protecting consumers from extreme market prices by securing long-term
electricity contracts and implementing a tiered rate structure to reward and
encourage conservation. Approximately 53% of California households will not
experience any rate increase. The next 23% of residential customers will
experience about a 10% average increase. Residential customers who use the
most electricity (i.e., significantly more than 130% of the ""baseline""
figure listed on each customer's bill), will experience a rate increase of
24% on average.

		 Subject: DWR Stranded Cost Update

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West 
Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the 
above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their 
analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the 
agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state 
in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their 
nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we 
excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas 
portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  
These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  
Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The 
spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative 
""mark-to-market"" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  
Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

1,"Attached is a file with my allocations of Texas Operations to be used for the 
2000 Plan.  However, please note that their are some problems/clean-up that 
needs to occur that I could not do.

As you requested, I have taken the % we allocated to Gas Assets last year and 
put the appropriate %'s into the appropriate group within Gas Assets as you 
have broken them out.  Please note:  Gas Network Trading is the same group as 
ST GasTexas (group 8) - Tom Martin is responsible for both.  I have indicated 
the appropriate %'s into the NEW buckets, but I was not able to ZERO out the 
ST GasTexas group as the cells are protected.  Consequently, the TOTAL column 
indicates that I have allocated over 100%.  The #'s in Gas Network Trading 
are correct.  Will you please delete ST GasTexas so that no one will allocate 
to it?
When the plan allocations were submitted last year, there was an error in 
RC1160 - Volume Management.  I thought we corrected it but it is still 
showing up incorrectly.  Please move the 8% under East Origin to ST GasEast.  
I was not able to correct this either as the cells have been protected.  
Please note:  This is not a change from the plan, but a correction of an 
error. 

I would appreciate you correcting these things for me, and forwarding the 
corrected version back to me for my records.  I will be working with our 
management team on the 1/00 allocations, and will provide you those by 
Friday.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.


MANAGEMENT TEAM:  Please review, and work on how we should be allocated for 
1/00.  We have changes for Denver business, Project Sally, NewCo, etc.  We 
will discuss in the staff meeting on Tuesday, 1/18.

Subject: Questions re: Siemens Negotiations




Rob - We've reviewed your memo which sets forth general points of your
negotiations with Siemens.  Following are comments and questions regarding
certain negotiated points:

EOT Claim Agreement

Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on oil;
if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 
commissioning
obligations

We observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner
to correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations, it is
introduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the
owner for affecting the Contractor's ability to commission.

Risk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas

We understand that the Facility is under the care, custody and control of the
Owner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance 
coverage
intended for the commercial operating period (versus the construction period).
Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance 
coverage
if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor
action during commissioning on gas.  We are also advising the Lenders to have
this point reviewed by an insurance advisor.

Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during
commissioning

During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to
test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of
curves.  It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach.
We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the
benefit of Siemens.  We trust that your operations experts will diligently
review the basis for the curves.

Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven by
owner

Please explain the rationale behind forgiving $4 million of Contractor LDs.

Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas

During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand
down until 7/1/01 when gas is available, no LDs would be paid related to oil
firing performance, and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is
not complete within 60 days.  We do not understand the above negotiated point.
Please confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated
point.

TAA Agreement

No 12-month look back.

We assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored 
into
the availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an
extension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result 
of
dropping below the availability standards.  Please explain how this negotiated
point affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how 
availability
will be calculated.  As we noted during our last conference call, we are
concerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if
maintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not
being dispatched.

12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas
commissioning unless owner delay.

We interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the 12-month clock for 
the
initial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it
takes the Contractor to commission on gas (unless delays are attributable to
Owner) and re-starts after Contractor has successfully completed the 
performance
testing on gas.  Please confirm that our understanding is correct.

In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if
there are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated
that we will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business
interruption insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve
the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects,
design, and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.
Incidentally, for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which
is not a new technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18
months per event with US$150,000 deductible.

Stone & Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review 
this
point.

Thanks in advance for your response.  Hope all is well.

Regards,

Bradley

Active Physical Positions	38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	345.0 	
VaR ($thousands)	159.4 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	0	
		


Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

The Outlook

LOS ANGELES

Helmut Ackermann founded L.A. Dye & Print Works Inc. 18
years ago, when he took over a bankrupt dye house. Today,
thanks to California's worsening energy crisis, L.A. Dye &
Print is back on the brink of closure.

Mr. Ackermann depends on natural gas to operate the
massive boilers and heaters used to color and dry fabrics.
He expects his December gas bill to have jumped to
$600,000 from $132,000 last January. Hammered by the
soaring costs, he has already closed one plant and
dismissed 40 people. Now, he says the jobs of his
remaining 660 workers are in jeopardy. ""If it stays the
way it is, we won't be around very long,"" Mr. Ackermann
says.

Stories like this are causing economists to worry that
California's economic troubles -- the energy crisis,
combined with a high-tech shakeout and growing labor
unrest in the entertainment industry -- could put more
drag on a U.S. economy that is already downshifting.

The energy mess is ""one more negative added to the mix,""
says Tom Lieser, a senior economist at the University of
California at Los Angeles's Anderson Business Forecast. He
expects California to navigate its way through the
immediate crisis but worries about its longer-term impact.
Questions about the reliability and cost of the state's
power supply, for example, could threaten continued growth
of vital industries such as technology.

Some Wall Street economists worry that California's
problems could spill over and hurt the broader U.S.
economy. In a report titled ""California Unplugged -- A
Drag on Global Growth?"" Morgan Stanley Dean Witter warns
that California's energy crisis threatens to push up
production costs and make U.S. exports from the state,
which totaled $102.9 billion in 1999, less competitive on
world markets.

""Negatives tend to snowball, so what is happening in
California has the potential to exacerbate the weakness we
already are seeing in the U.S. economy,"" says Joseph
Quinlan, a Morgan Stanley economist.

Other states facing economic and financial trouble
wouldn't warrant such attention. But California not only
is the nation's largest state in terms of both population
and economic heft, but the Golden State also seemed to
epitomize the New Economy. Job growth in the state has
been double that in the nation as a whole; of the 2.1
million jobs created in the U.S. during the first 11
months of last year, one of every five new hires was in
California. The state produced more than $1.2 trillion in
output in 1999, making it the sixth-largest economy in the
world, slightly smaller than the economy of the United
Kingdom and a little bigger than that of Italy. The
state's economic output contributed about 12% of total
U.S. gross domestic product. New York, in second place,
had an 8.1% share of GDP.

But soaring energy costs are beginning to take a toll on
the Golden State, and low-end manufacturers are among the
first to see the change. ""It is forcing many of us to face
a shutdown,"" says Scott Edwards, president of the
Association of Textile Dyers, Printers and Finishers of
Southern California. His industry runs on gross profit
margins of 10% to 15%, hardly enough to handle the
fivefold increase in natural-gas costs that many operators
have witnessed.

Soaring energy prices also are hurting California's
agricultural industry. ""We can't pass along the costs of
production"" as some other industries do, says Heather
Flower, a spokeswoman for the Western Growers Association,
a group of 3,500 growers in California and Arizona. Some
are cutting back on plantings of broccoli, lettuce and
strawberries, among other crops, because of uncertainty
about costs.

Electricity prices already are on the march. The state's
largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co., received temporary rate increases
last week ranging from 9% for residential customers to 15%
for large companies. Some economists say the rises, if
they become permanent, could wipe out a large chunk of
per-capita-income gains and result in less consumer
spending.

On top of the energy problems, Hollywood is bracing for a
strike by the Writers Guild of America and the unions
representing film and television actors, whose contracts
are set to expire this year. The studios spent the end of
2000 jamming in production to cushion the impact of a
potential strike. The sector employs nearly 300,000 people
in the state.

While there seems little doubt that the troubles brewing
in California will prove painful, there are reasons to
believe the state can still avert an outright economic
contraction. Its economy is more diversified and resilient
than a decade ago, when national-defense cutbacks and an
overbuilt property market crippled the local economy. Back
then, jobs in the aerospace sector shrank by 70%, and
office-vacancy rates in major markets soared.

Also, despite all the attention being given to the state's
energy crisis, the fact is ""we're not a very
energy-intensive economy,"" says Ted Gibson, chief state
economist with California's department of finance. He
notes that the state ranks 48th among the 50 states in
per-capita energy consumption. And he adds that the $11
billion in deficit spending racked up by the two big
utilities amounts to less than 1% of state output. ""It's
not the kind of cost that will bring the state to its
knees,"" he says.

"
2,"Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the 
mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale 
businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around 
mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test 
- i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of 
transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  
Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of 
explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does 
happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we 
believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where 
operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. 

These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which 
Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely 
designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to 
produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and 
potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that 
are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage 
success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class 
practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep 
review process would follow this set of steps:

 1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This 
is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be 
notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain 
that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 

 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell 
them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in 
making information and personnel available to complete the review.  

 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key 
commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and 
key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The 
deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process 
and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  

 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of 
the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those 
which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested.  
This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually 
very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support 
their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an 
additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with 
this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support 
the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office 
know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing 
so. 

 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be 
reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls 
and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, 
assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate 
personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume 
responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and 
to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey 
to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, 
doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep 
findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep 
teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each 
doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me 
sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick 
before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular 
concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more 
timely manner than quarterly.   

Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in 
Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors 
in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not 
concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the 
integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were 
discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's 
practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley 
was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted 
Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was 
for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  

Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from 
Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the 
case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I 
know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you 
would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when 
they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as 
a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in 
this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert 
them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the 
level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing 
directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and 
myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the 
download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice 
mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a 
meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona 
mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked 
for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the 
integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control 
which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  

To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the 
heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is 
to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to 
offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire 
Enron organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The 
findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, 
which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to 
""over-wordsmith"" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be 
surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can 
reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical 
perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  

I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with 
you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as 
valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain 
members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other 
businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any 
suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process."

Subject:	PSW Day 2

Good Afternoon,

Here is my Laundry list for today:

My saved sheet does not save all of my criteria selections in build route.  When I re-open, I have to select the day of week mask filtering and report changes again.  It is defaulted to checked in the new sheet, but erases upon saving and reopening.
Fixed - Saved sheet will save all the selection criteria.

I also do not see where to find the changes to existing deals that I want to see reported.  How do I get to those?  In the original build route, it was a second tab in the excel sheet.  
You can see deal changes in Log tab, next to Route Data tab.

Routing does not show an OK on rows with the sched term of ""BOM"", but it does route them.
The workspace error log gave the following error on these rows of ""No Supply Data available for Term Routing.  Just have BOM equal Day in the logic of routing.


The workspace error log does not pop to the front of all active applications, nor does it have a space on the tool bar.  I thought the sheet was frozen again, and started minimizing applications until it suddenly popped up. Just clicking on the PSW does not bring the workspace error log to the front.



One problem with many other problems imbedded in it.

The Global ID column needs to be able to hold up to 30 characters, I had numerous rows with the notation ""IDACCISO0010 and SRP_WESC101P_CISO"" . 
Increased the Column Size to 50 in Stage, Will do the same changes in Production as soon as Production Freez ends.
 
This gave me an error ""General SQL error. ORA_01401: inserted value too large for column, but error check did not say anything. When I changed the cells and re-saved, I got the same message again, as if the rows are permanently embedded with these values.   I had to delete the rows and re-paste them in from the sheet to get them to work.  This would have been problematic had I not had my working sheet in Excel.

The rows that had this notation were not sent to Path Confirmation, but were changed from X to R in the PSW.
These are routed but, path is not confirmed. 


Please call me if these explanations do not make sense, I will be happy to explain myself further.

Thanks,

Here is a draft of the letter to Constellation
Carol
"
2,"Dear Jerry:
First let me say that I am excited about having your family 92.5 Acres for
sale.
It is a good combination place and I feel there is a good market for it.

The mixture of woods, pasture, creek and home with a very private setting
are
some of the features that will have a great deal of appeal in today's
market.

I have completed the market analysis on the property and based on the
comparison of sales and asking prices of comparable properties and business
conditions in general at this time I  feel the market is indicating a
probable
sale price of $170,000 which figures out at about $1,300 per acre for the
land
and timber and the remaining $49,750 for the home and other improvements.

I have made an itemized estimate in the remarks section of the listing
agreement
of typical seller's closing costs for your review.

After you have had an opportunity to look over the agreement and talk with
your
brothers give me a call to answer any question you may have.

If the three of you feel you would like to begin marketing at a somewhat
higher
price and see what the market will bear we can do that. I have learned a
long time
ago that I can never say exactly what a place will or will not sell for. All
said and
done,  what a property will sell for is what a buyer is willing to give.

Our marketing efforts will expose your property to a good number of
qualified
buyers who are ready and able to buy, many of them for all cash.

Chris gave me his email address and I am send a copy of this letter and
attachments
to him also.

I do not have an email address for Don. You can forward on a copy to him.

Here is a brief outline of what you need to do before sending the papers
back to me.


1. Decide on the listing price and enter it in paragraph no. 1
2. Sign and return a copy of the ""Information about Brokerage
      Services Form""
       3.   To the best of your ability complete the three page form called
      ""Seller's Disclosure Notice"". This is a form that discloses any
      information a buyer should be told about the  home on property.
      Initial the bottom of the first two pages and sign the last page.
4. For your convenience each of you can sign a separate listing
      agreement and Agency Relationship form and return them.
5. When returning these form we need the originally signed copy
      so return them in regular mail.
6. Please remember to include a key to the house and barn and
      give me the gate lock combination.

Call me if you have a question and I will be looking forward to hearing from
you soon.

We are already in the process of selecting prospects from our files that we
feel will
interested in your property.

Yours truly,
JoEd Anderson

As per my voicemail, I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. Could I ask that you confirm the following regarding RMTC - Global Markets and Enron Metals and Commodities Corp

That you are a director, and therefore authorised signatories of the companies?
Would your signature be required on any new trading agreement for both companies?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Good morning Vince,

Christie has suggested that I be the liaison for John Martin and your 
research project 'Enron - Case Study of a Company Reinventing Itself'.  

In John's lastest email, he suggested that the first week of December works 
with his schedule - up to December 6th - or the following couple of weeks 
after Dec. 8th.  Do these dates work for you as well?  If so, I will proceed 
in booking one hour sessions with the following Enron management:

Ken Lay
Jeff Skilling
Andy Fastow

If these dates do not work for you let me know when you are available and I 
will try to coordinate with John, Jeff, Ken and Andy.  Also, I will send an 
introductory email to John.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you,

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

The following message and attachements are from Brian Hiebert:

Enclosed for your review and comment is both a clean copy and a blacklined 
draft of the proposed form of Asset Purchase Agreement prepared by the 
solicitors for the receiver, KPMG.

I have taken that agreement and redrafted it to provide for direct 
representations and warranties from the Banks to Enron regarding such issues 
as title, status of contracts, financial statements, and otherwise.

This agreement should be viewed as a preliminary draft only as I did not have 
the benefit of reviewing the schedules which will form part of the 
agreement.  I understand those schedules are being prepared and will be 
forwarded to us together with a possibly revised version of this agreement.  
Also coming over is a form of debt purchase agreement.

Once I have received those agreements and have had an opportunity to review 
them together with their schedules I expect further changes will result.  
Further changes may also result from the continuation of due diligence 
through the course of this week and next.

However, I think the enclosed is a dramatic improvement from Enron's 
perspective over the form of purchase and sale agreement proposed by KPMG.

I look forward to discussing this with you.  In the meantime, if you have any 
questions please feel free to give me a call.

at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria."

 Dad, & Linda-
Can you go ahead and contact the band, I sent an e-mail to the wedding 
coordinator and she has not responded (she is new to e-mail) and I'm afraid 
we might lose them. Also, she recommended a photographer out of Atlanta, I 
love his work, he does candid more so than the traditional portraits. He also 
did a number of the Kennedy's weddings, etc. I'll try and get a price quote, 
but I might need your help in negotiations. Also, she send some information 
on a decorator/ florist who seems phenomenal, I don't know if Linda might be 
willing to help me out with that as she knows a lot more about both flowers 
and decoration than I do. The Ballroom at the Ritz is pretty basic and he can 
turn it into anything but basic. Also, that we if we find a church that is 
not so amazing, he can decorate that as well. 
The name of the photographer is Dennis Reggie and his number is 404- 
873-8088.  Linda Kessler has all the information on the florist, her number 
is 888 524 1326.
Mom is going to be responsible for the RSVP's for the wedding.  I will get a 
fax machine this weekend. 
Let me know if this is a problem and I will try and arrange some of this from 
down here, it is just difficult for people to call internationally.
I love you!

Hi Mary, 
I don't have a clue who filed the original documents.  I know for a 
fact that ROW did not do the filing for this transaction.  It seems 
to me it would have been someone on EB38 who did the filing. 
Back a couple of months ago there were copies of some of the 
agreements in a meeting AE, Patrick Johnson, and I had (I 
think AE brought her copies to the meeting).  So, it would 
stand to reason that these copies should exist in AE's 
""Enron"" files left on EB38.  I don't think I ever saw the 
originals though.

Dear Robert:  Do you recall what you did with the documents relating to
Bridgeline whereby the Napoleonville land was kept out of the
transaction by being deeded over to LRCI, Inc.?  Patrick Johnson recalls
you were involved with those documents, and we're trying to find them.
Ann Elizabeth White said that she believes the files are here in Legal,
but we can't locate them.  Patrick Johnson's recollection that you might
have filed the conveyance documents is what leads me to ask you if you
have them or know where they are.  
Thanks for letting me pick your brain on (yet again) another document

Question: As a hospital/geriatric social worker, both
in my personal and work life I am frequently asked the
following question:  ""My elderly [parent, aunt,
neighbor...] clearly needs some help at home, but
refuses this help [even if free, or done by a family
member, a church...].  How can I convince this person
to accept help?""

After I've determined that the issue isn't financial
(usually a solvable problem), then I am frequently at a
loss.  The situations I've seen like this seem to only
resolve after a crisis occurs, and the person has no
choice. 

How would you approach a situation like this?  The
issues seem to revolve around pride, retaining control,
denial of illness, aging or disability...  Any
thoughts?

Response: In his 'Notes From The Underground',
Dostoevsky wrote, ""Human behavior is motivated by the
craving for absolute freedom and self-assertion in
defiance of all dictates of reason.""  As decrepitude
takes its toll on our bodies -- and minds -- often
pride is the only thing we have left.

Waiting for a crisis is excruciating for folks who
think of themselves as caregivers when it comes to
organizing care for people who have less and less
capacity to take care of themselves or their personal
surroundings.

Probably the wisest thing to do is ask a whole lot of
questions.  Using the example of children of an elderly
parent, first the concerned children need to ask
themselves what are their own interests.  Do they want
to assuage guilt?  Do they fear that harm will come to
their parent?  Are they concerned that a crisis will
interrupt the normal course of their own lives?

Questions also need to be asked of the parent: What
most concerns you about your situation -- health,
comfortable surroundings, companionship, your capacity
to hold your head up and say, ""Daughter please! I can
do it myself!""  One can also ask, ""What do you think
are the standards that determine one's capacity to live
an independent life?""

This questioning approach brings the parties into
fuller participation in the decision-making process. 
When I ask you a question it means I am taking you
seriously; the reverse is equally true.  In
negotiation, this technique is called Active Listening.

The crucial element is listening closely to all the
elements of the responses to those questions, both the
questions one asks oneself and the questions asked of
other people.  It is no less important to respond to
what people say by checking to make sure you've
understood their points; you may want to say, ""This is
what I understood you to have said; is my understanding
correct?""  You also want to indicate, ""The fact that I
understand what you have said does not necessarily mean
I agree with you.""

Clinging on to the visual indicators of independence is
a critical vital sign.  The fear of loving relatives
that something bad can happen has to be balanced
against the knowledge that if you kick someone in their
self-esteem, you are attacking a most vulnerable part
of their anatomy.  You cannot negotiate away a person's
self-esteem, but you can destroy it through frontal and
flanking attacks.

The frustration faced by folks who see loved ones
failing to take proper care of themselves is
phenomenal.  Very often the people who have advocated
professional care ultimately must mutter (hopefully to
themselves) the unsatisfying statement, ""I told you
so.""

In your question you indicate that crisis forces
choice.  Perhaps the best approach is to prepare a
safety net that is ready when the crisis occurs.  It
cannot prevent a crisis from happening; and it is
crucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened by
forcing the 'victim' of it to lose face. But having
that safety net ready can at least reduce the force of
the fall.

Relationship is one of the seven most significant
issues to consider in negotiation.  Focusing on the
relationship with an elderly parent or friend, not
letting decrepitude get in the way of love and caring
can make it much easier when someone's self-esteem is
attacked by a crisis.  Looking at oneself and saying,
""It's not my fault,"" is not a way of avoiding blame,
but rather giving a loved one the freedom to make their
own mistakes -- just as they did the first time they
gave us the keys to the car.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially

Subject: Compound Model for Reedy Creek

Alex,

Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a 
couple of additional changes.

1.   The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike 
payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be 
discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values.
2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree 
approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature 
method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities.
3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for 
anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation 
since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.

Thanks,

Stinson

pressure.

In subsequent conversations between Dan Rieneke and Wildhorse personnel
yesterday, the following information was relayed:

(1)  The CAT compressor was used only for the Natural Buttes gas being
routed through the South Canyon area.  We are not sure where they took it.
It was most likely a rental unit.
(2)  Increase in field pressures late last week was due to a compressor
going down.  Overhaul of that unit was not complete until late yesterday
(Monday), and we should have started to see some pressure relief again last
evening.  Putting the compressor back on line will only restore pressures to
their levels prior to the shutdown.
(3)  Wildhorse field management will correct any mis-information obtained by

that we are ""overproduced"" on paper by 76,162 Dth/Mo.   I think that we need 
to bring the nominations up to balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and, a 
corresponding volume at Meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on Strangers to 
keep the physical side in line.  If my understanding is correct (and if not,

1,"I attended the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association's Annual 
Post-Session Legislative Meeting, July 9 - 12.

Presentations were made by Louisiana Representatives Damico, Daniel, 
Montgomery, Pierre; Senators Barham, Theunissen; and Governor Foster's Deputy 
Chief of Staff covering the 2001 session, the upcoming special session in 
October and next year's ""Fiscal Only"" Session.

Although the vast majority of issues of interest to the industry were dealt 
with without much media attention, three issues - retail gasoline pricing, 
water policy management and the processing tax - received considerable media 
attention. 

Except as noted below, no legislation actively opposed by the oil and gas 
industry survived the legislative process.

The only setback for the industry dealt with legislation brought by an array 
of local government groups - police jurors, school boards, sheriffs, 
assessors and municipalities - in response to the continuing controversy over 
the parish property taxes paid by interstate pipeline companies. As part of 
the dispute, many pipeline companies have paid a portion of their taxes under 
protest - and that portion paid under protest, prior to passage of SB 1046, 
could not be budgeted or spent by local governments. While the passage of SB 
1046 will allow parish governing bodies to spend the protested taxes, a 
number of amendments offered by supporters of industry and taxpayer fairness 
were adopted that will work to assure that the taxpayers will get their money 
back in a timely manner if they prevail.

Although the Public Service Commission has the authority to open up the 
electric market to competition, the Legislature recognizes the importance of 
additional generation capacity and passed legislation urging the LA. Dept. of 
Economic Development to explore ways, including possible incentives, to 
encourage additional unregulated electric generation to be developed in 
Louisiana.

Water management received a lot of attention due to several plans for 
generating plants that would use groundwater (unlike Enron's plans to use 
surface water). SB 965 creates a Ground Water Management Commission that has 
the authority to define critical areas and regulate withdrawals in those 
areas. It also creates a Ground Water Advisory Task Force that provides for 
local and industry participation.

As far as the upcoming special session and the 2002 session are concerned, 
taxes will be in the forefront, including the much- dreaded processing tax , 
which would cost Enron about $50 million. According to the participating 
legislators and the Governor's staff, the processing tax is gaining momentum 
because of Sen. Foster Campbell persistence in bringing it up year after year 
and his promises that the processing tax will take care of Louisiana's budget 
problems. The industry will continue to vigorously oppose this tax.

Donald, Gavin and Jerry - I am sending you a summary of Louisiana Legislative 
Bills pertaining to the energy industry."

Thanks for the info.  A couple of things about the data: 1) What does the (7,849) BCF represent?  Is that all of ENA Gas?(We can do away with the East and West and just report it as US)  Have we really gotten that much shorter from 11/30, when we were (219) BCF short?  2) Can you also provide the p&l numbers for columns Q through T?

Thanks,
Chris

1,"Les Rawson has spoken with Doug Reiner at Willamette regarding this deal. 
They are in agreement now about the prices. Les said he usually has to 
explain the methodology a few times when he does deals with these guys, so 
it's nothing new. But in the future, Les said he'd prefer to contact the 
counterparty first to avoid confusion. His extension is 3924. You're also 
more than welcome to call me first and I'll track Les down. (I think I'm 
probably easier to get ahold of!) 

At any rate, I hope this clears it up. And if Willamette has any other 
questions, let me know.

Thanks,

2,"On sunday we had a problem with PSCO, they tried to back out of a purchase from El Paso since they claimed they were picking up the power at the FC 230 bus instead of the 345 bus.  Also there is an issue with the schedule being until further.  This once again highlights our need to be as clear as possible on ALL aspects of the deals that we do.  All new people should have a discussion with myself or another senior member as to the differences between the FC's busses, N. Gila vs. Devers and other points on the grid that you are unsure of.

thanks,

0,"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

I'd like to have the information as soon as it is available each month.  I don't know what the regular close schedule is so I don't know when it would be safe to extract the data and be sure that you have the entire month's activity.  Our expense close is on the fifth workday so I'd like to aim for  a date as close to there as is possible.

Karl,

Here is a file with December's data from our QA environment.  The program that produces this data will be in production later today, so I'll get you a file from PR1 then.  I had to zip it up because it was too big to deliver.  I'll set you up with an userid and password so you can pick these up off our interface server once it is scheduled in production.

I'm now settled in London.  If you need to reach me, I'm at 783-4269 (trunk+34269).

Thanks,
Shawn

2,"Hi, Jeff.

I have been receiving several inquiries from UH volunteers on the Recruiting List wanting to confirm Nov 12 and 13.  I've been responding that we are waiting to review the resumes to determine the number of people needed to interview and greet.  

Most of the volunteers are Manager and above and need to mark their calendars now to avoid scheduling meetings on those days.  Greeters also need to obtain approval from their managers to take a day off with such short notice.  When do you think we'll know for sure the number of volunteers needed?  Also, do you have a need to review the resumes to select the on campus interview candidates?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: Revised Petition and Points and  Authorities
Attached is the revised Petition and Points and Authorities  (the Sept. 8 Draft"").  This draft has not been redlined because the changes  and additions are extensive.  Future revisions will be  redlined.
 
This draft will be revised to clarify the arguments, to  include page references to the exhibits, to include missing authorities, and to  eliminate typos, etc.
 
The argument is that the Commission acted contrary to state  and federal constitutional guaranties (a de novo standard of review) and that  the Commission acted in excess of its authority and contrary to law thereby  abusing its discretion (a substantial evidence standard of review).
 
You will be provided a revised draft by noon on Monday (Sept  10) which I anticipate will be substantially complete.  As soon as it is  available, I will send it to you.  At that time do you want it also sent to  the addressees listed in ypur Friday Email?  EWD

3,"Hi Dan:

Just an update to let you know the status of the agreements between Reliant
and Enovate and Enron.  They are both being routed internally prior to
execution.  However, due to the ""Notices"" section missing from the Enovate
contract, Legal has asked that I forward that to you for execution prior to
Reliant's execution.  I hope that this is not a problem.

Dan, I don't want this contract to get misdirected, Enron's so large and
that could easily happen.  Could you please send me your direct mailing
address so that I may send it directly to you for your further handling?
Thanks, I appreciate so much your help in getting these two agreements
completed.

YOu can either call me or email me your direct mailing address and I'll
send you the Enovate contract as soon as I receive it.

Thank you,
Ellen

3,"Mike,

As a result of the recent reorganization, initially I will be responsible for 
the Weather and Insurance trading activities.  I look forward to working with 
you in these efforts.

What I really wanted to talk to you about is the JDF Walk.  Last year we 
discovered that our 2 1/2 year old son, Brandon, had diabetes.  As you 
remember, and certainly can relate to, this changed our lives forever.  In 
retrospect, I am glad that I got involved in Enron's effort even though it 
was in the last 3-4 weeks.  We have continued to stay involved with JDF by 
attending several events, by visiting the JDF office, and by JDF's proactive 
phone out-reach.  I would like to hear your take on sponsoring a team through 
Enron vs. directly through JDF.  I know that Enron matches the contributions 
if sponsored through Enron; is this possible if we were to go the other route?

Please call or email as I know we are approaching the campaign time.

Thanks,
Todd Hall

Subject:	CA Proceeding; exposure; netting of purchases & sales; offset of receivables

I called a meeting among Linda Robertson, Gary Fergus, Amanda Smith and RA yesterday evening to compare notes on the status of the captioned matters and determine what activities we would need to undertake going forward.  The following matters were discussed:

1.	Refund exposure / netting of purchases and sales
2.	Receivable from ISO related to business conducted in various trade months
3.	Receivable from PX related to business conducted in various trade months
4.	Receivable related to the underscheduling penalty
5.	Receivable related to the negative CTC

1.	Regarding the first matter, Gary reviewed with us the initial numbers on California exposure relating to our sales in the ISO and PX markets, and our purchases in those markets which may potentially be used to offset this exposure.  We discussed the need to update this study in view of the new data recently provided by the ISO in the proceeding.  Gary will work with Charles River to move forward on this.  The new exposure/netting numbers should be available either at the end of this week, or the middle of next week, due to demands on Charles River related to a Monday filing deadline in the Pac NW proceeding.  A ""block forward"" issue related to our accounting for sales and purchases, and involving the inclusion of price data related to non-physical, swap transactions, will also be analyzed by Charles River to determine its effect on the numbers that are being generated by the ISO and its impact on our refund exposure.  

2.	I shared information related to money owed us by the ISO for business conducted in various trade months, developed with the help of Kit Blair.  This info takes the form of a certification by the chief financial officer of the ISO as to the correctness of various attached information, schedules and invoices generated by ISO and related to these various trade months.  Kit advises as of yesterday that we are owed $42,891,411 by the ISO.

3.	Information was also shared with regard to amounts owed us by the PX for business conducted in various trade months.  This info took the form of an EPMI account summary on PX letterhead and an overview spread sheet (with accompanying backup data) apparently provided by ISO.  The contact person on this matter is Chris Stokley.  I do not have confirmation on an up to date figure yet from Chris, but my prior notes indicate that this receivable is approximately $8MM.

4.	I also shared information on money due us by virtue of the underscheduling penalty mechanism.  Again, Kit Blair provided me this info, which consists of an ISO generated notice and schedule which indicates that EPMI is owed $33,838,246.08

5.	Finally, I shared a spread sheet obtained from Wanda Curry, as to the magnitude of the negative CTC receivable.

The deliverables coming out of the meeting were for Gary and Amanda to take the lead in updating and developing the foregoing items into evidentiary proof/affidavits suitable for use in the proceeding, coordinating with us, Dan Watkiss / Shelby Kelley and the various contacts.  A listing of the contacts to be made and potential affiants/witnesses follows: 

Contact for amounts owed us by ISO- 	Kit Blair, Staff Trading Supt.
Contact for amounts owed us by PX-		Chris Stokley, Associate
Affiant for the info developed above-	Murray O'Neil, Sr. Director Trading Supt.	 
Contact and affiant for negative CTC- 	Wanda Curry, VP Risk Management
Offset of purchases and sales-		Undefined; possibilities- Jan Acton, Seabron Adamson, 							internal person?

I am available for the remainder of the week to help coordinate Gary and Amanda's communication with these contacts.  Alan Comes will be the primary coordinator next week during my absence; although I will be reachable on my cell should the need arise. 

Thanks,  Ray

Barbara, 
I shall be back in the office on Wednesday and will call you to talk about the data. Some time series are in public domain and I hope we shall be able to give you this information without facing any problems. The data we buy from vendors, will require a formal release. I hope the vendors will allow us to do this but we shall need a formal letter from you saying that you will use the data for research only. Finally, the release of compilation of the OTC prices will require an approval from the trading desks. The traders tend to be difficult sometimes. 
What is the best number to reach you on Wednesday? 
Best Holiday Wishes to you and your Family.

3,"CIG Dusts Off Ruby Pipeline, Plans Extension to Sacramento, CA 
El Paso subsidiary Colorado Interstate Gas is dusting off its Ruby Pipeline project in light of the scramble to increase deliveries to the California market. The project, which originally was announced in 1998 to serve northern Nevada, will be extended to Reno, NV, and into California, the pipeline said in an open season announcement. 
""In response to increased demand for gas supply in northern Nevada and northern California markets, Colorado Interstate Gas Co. (CIG) is announcing an open season to evaluate constructing interstate gas transmission capacity from the Rockies to these markets,"" the announcement states. ""Natural gas production from the Rocky Mountain supply basins is projected to increase dramatically over the next few years and the Ruby Pipeline Project (Ruby) will provide access to these supplies."" 
CIG said it has been working with shippers interested in developing an 850-mile 30- and 36-inch diameter pipeline running from western Wyoming through Elko, NV, Reno, Yuba City, CA, and ending in Sacramento, CA. CIG also anticipates interconnecting in Northern California with Wild Goose Storage, which is currently holding its own open season to evaluate expanding its facility. Ruby will be capable of providing up to 750 MDth per day of incremental transportation capacity to these areas. It is anticipated to be in service in late 2003. 
Parties interested in obtaining transportation service to delivery points in northern Nevada and Northern California are invited to submit bids in this open season, which started on April 23 and will close on May 31. Questions concerning the open season should be directed to Craig Coombs at (719) 520-4387; Ed Miller (719) 520-4305; or Tom Dobson (719) 520-4606.

0,"ambiguity (am-bi-GYOO-i-tee) noun

   1. Doubtfulness or uncertainty as regards interpretation.

   2. Something of doubtful meaning.

[From Latin ambiguus, uncertain, from ambigere, to go about : ambi-, around +
agere, to drive.]

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/ambiguity.gif

AMBIGUITY
        Ambiguity is one of a handful of English words whose meaning
describes itself. In other words, ""Ambiguity"" is ambiguous. It refers, on
the one hand, to a situation of imprecision, of obscurity, because more
than one interpretation is possible. On the other hand, something ambiguous
can be understood perfectly well - but from more than one point of view.
        We are amused at the fable of the elephant and the six blind men,
each of whom understood the elephant to be a very different animal. But we
seem to lose that good-natured perspective just in time to assume that our
own point of view on the world is more accurate than that of many of the
other human beings on the planet. We avoid ambiguity as much as possible,
feeling threatened that it may expose our own point of view as merely an
option.
        But we should embrace ambiguity. After all, each of our eyes sees a
slightly different, two-dimensional, view of reality. Those two images are
synthesized by the brain into a single three-dimensional image, which we
think of as ""more real"" than a 2-D view. The more points of view we are able
to see, the more clearly we understand the world around us. Reality is
ambiguous. Ambiguity is synthesis.
        I like to think that looking at everything - not only words -
from alternate points of view, can enhance our understanding of the world
around us.

AMBIGRAMS
Ambigrams are words that can be read from more than one point of view.
I have been creating ambigrams as visual meditations on language--as
commercial graphics and as fine art pieces--for almost thirty years.
Anu has invited me to share my unique point of view on language with
his A.Word.A.Day audience. I certainly appreciate this opportunity. I
hope you will enjoy looking at words in this new way and find it both
entertaining and thought-provoking.

Each day this week, your AWAD regular mail will consist of an ambigram, a
paragraph or so about a particular word, exploring some unorthodox points
of view regarding its meaning.  As it really makes more sense to view the
ambigram first, and in a format that allows you to invert it, I suggest
that you print it out, so you can enjoy its symmetry and reversibility
before and while you read.          -John Langdon (langdojw@drexel.edu)

(This week's Guest Wordsmith, John Langdon, teaches in the College of
Design Arts at Drexel University in Philadelphia. For more information
on ambigrams visit his Website: http://www.coda.drexel.edu/wordplay .)

3,"GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin the week of October 15th.
Two schedules are being offered:
	Course # 7129-00:  Tuesdays, Oct 16 - Dec 11 (no class Nov 20)
	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should
enroll in their preferred schedule and stick to that schedule.

Course details:
	- Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron employees
	- Each course is limited to eight students
	- Meets once a week for eight weeks
	- Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
		include initial exam)
	- Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
	- Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
	- Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
		GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
	- Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition
Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"", 
			please indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  
If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.
		C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
			tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.  
			FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is required on the registration form.  
			Be sure to indicate complete cardholder information.
	3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be honored.  
Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on awaiting list for the course or courses indicated.
Enrollments and waitlists will be confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

3,"John, I look forward to you being there, hopefully,  for both days.  Your 
presence and participation shows the field teams the environmental commitment 
from Houston. 

Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations.  The second 
moring will be devoted to a  ""surprise"" participation at a local compressor 
station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque.  I havent spread this around yet, 
except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but  I plan on dividing the guys into 
groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor 
station.  I plan on setting and hiding  some placebo environmental issues the 
night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other 
housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.  We will then convine 
back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they 
would address the issues identified.  The group that identifies the most 
issues, will get a small gift.  Do I need your approval on the spending of 
some $$$ for a gift?  I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for 
the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they 
want.  The final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental 
situations under varying circumstances, like we did last year with the whole 
group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams.

3,"Attached for your initial review are Enron Corp. comments on the Marketing Affiliate NOPR (RM01-10).   As you will see, this is an incomplete, bare bones version and we can enhance the arguments once it is clear we all agree with them.  Leslie has struggled mightily with this in light of the constant changes that have been going on and we are sure more changes will be necessary.

Comments must be filed at FERC by December 20.  In order to allow adequate time for a couple of redrafts and the concomitant reviews along with the other things that are going on, please advise me or Leslie of any suggestions, concerns or comments you have by COB MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26th.

3,"Between last night and this morning, I talked to Brian Coad and figured out 
what was going on.  The file confirms that someone in Risk Management put 
this deal on hold in November.  I talked to Jason by phone last night and he 
confirmed that this is what happened.  I had placed calls to Frost since 
working on the project but the lawyer did not rush to call since he has been 
out of the office until their business folks started pressing them this 
week.  So, I completed a legal review & figured out what the remaining issues 
are that need to be resolved with counsel.  (One of which was a convulated 
SEC issue that we figured out last night). I sent Brian a final draft and he 
is implementing those changes in a draft for his counsel.  His counsel is out 
of the office until Monday but Brian put us in contact.  I would predict that 
we will settle on the final terms on Monday, make minor changes to the final 
draft and get it executed by then.

2,"Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and 
complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk 
of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions 
with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.  
Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial 
people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back 
and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and 
standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it 
helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the 
long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, 
less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. 

A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get 
in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth 
et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized 
delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't 
quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish 
some of these goals as well.

In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  

Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.

Subject: Reporting Structure

Dave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the 
following. As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all 
other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT) 
report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. 

In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to 
me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the 
following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these 
individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than 
not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given 
somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea 
whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. 

Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing 
with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in 
Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and 
point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling 
unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was 
putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with 
Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very 
demotivated lawyer on my hands.

Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to ""stay 
in the loop"" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a 
dollar and time perspective.  

Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think 
its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I 
know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, 
inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between 
Houston and the employee.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

Regards
Milnthorp

3,"Larry - I've received a copy of the compliance order.  It assesses a penalty 
of $15,000 per day for each day of violation (May 1996 to September 8, 1997 
or  496 days).  This results in a fine of $7.44 million.  I hope the order 
has a typo and the NMED meant a penalty of ""up to"" $15,000 per day of 
violation. If this is not a typo I see no downside to asking for a hearing 
and a settlement conference. We may do so anyway.  Since we only have till 
mid-July to file the request for hearing which must include very specific 
admissions or denials and the basis of our affirmative defenses, I'd like 
Larry to flesh out the notes below and pull any relevant documentation 
together.....

Dave - let's discuss counsel for this matter in the morning and I'd like to 
make a call to NMED counsel.  I'd be tempted to bring Braddock in even though 
this is New Mexico...

Subject: Compliance Order, P-1 C/S

Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air 
Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 
C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this 
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further 
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was 
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of 
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing 
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide 
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to 
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received 
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, 
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher 
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not 
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by 
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is 
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern 
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this 
turbine at their descretion.

In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a 
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than 
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be 
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple 
cycle.   

  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to 
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the 
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern 
has 30 days to request another hearing. 

Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and 
handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
conference call for sometime next week? "

0," As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Subject: AGENCY.COM Presentation at BEA Users Conference

Here is the information regarding the presentation done by AGENCY.COM.

The BEA Users Conference is being held in San Francisco, CA 2/21-2/24.
The conference has over 2,000 registered users representing many types of 
companies.
About the Session and Presentation
On Wednesday, February 23 at 11:00 an hour long session was to open to any 
registered conference attendee.
Around 200 (very rough guess) people attended the session.
The session was moderated by Scott Dietzen, CTO BEA Server Division and was 
described as 
'Web E-Commerce Solutions: Using Best of Breed Technologies'.
The session included 4 panel members from Calico Commerce (an ISV), Idea 
Integration 
(an integrator), Cygent (an ISV) and AGENCY.COM.
Each of the 4 panel members gave a 12 minute presentation then the session 
was turned over
for general questions and answers.
Joe Tatem of AGENCY.COM went last and spoke about the web development 
marketplace: where 
it was and where it needed to head.
Like the other panel members he described his company and gave a little sales 
pitch for 
BEA Weblogic.
Tatem then presented a case study as an example of some of their work.
This example was of AGENCY.COM's work for Enron on EnronOnline.
His case study consisted of 2 slides.
The first slide had screen images of EnronOnline: one was the EnronOnline 
home page and the 
second was the quotes page populated with some products.
The quotes page was 'overlayed' on the home page and obscured the EnronOnline 
banner on the 
bottom so that only the 'ne' at the end showed.
The Enron logo (the counter-clockwise 45-degree logo was clearly visible. 
He talked about it being a Trading Extranet site but said he could not name 
the customer.
He described that real time prices for products were being displayed to 
customers.
He then showed the next slide which gave a high level overview of the 
application 
architecture for EnronOnline.
This slide contains details about real time server (RTServer) and its 
associated 
application server (including the RMI communication mechanism).
He made a comment about how they were particularly proud of the real time 
piece and how it 
was designed and how it worked.
This slide also contained a reference to the fact EnronOnline uses Oracle 8i.
He also mentioned Jesica as the content management piece and indicated that 
they were 
looking at other 3rd party products to replace that in their future projects.
This slide also contains a reference to StackManager and he indicated that it 
was developed 
by the unamed client and not by AGENCY.COM.
He also talked about ShockWave plugin being used in the browser to receive 
the 
real time quotes.
Only one question was asked from the audience during his showing of the 
technical 
architecture slide.
This question (paraphrased) was: When you use RMI between the web server and 
the 
app server how many connections do you use.
He replied (paraphrased): one per thread.
The questioner then asked something else that I assumed was a technical 
detail about how 
WebLogic RMI worked.
Tatem replied incorrectly and a BEA employee responded with the right answer.
About the Handouts of the Presentation
BEA tried to make available hard copies of all presentation slides in each 
session.
They setup a series of shelves that were numbered for each session.
The documents were available starting Monday during the registration process 
and 
throughout the conference.
On Monday evening I went to pick up hard copies of the sessions for which I 
was interested.
About a third of the handouts for the sessions were not available.
I did not notice whether the one for above mentioned presentation was 
available. (I did 
not expect it to one of the more interested ones.)
During some of the sessions BEA handed out copies to those present.
I did not see any handed out during the above mentioned session.
After the session was over I called Jay Webb and told him of the above 
details.
After telling Jay I saw Scott Dietzen from BEA in the hallway. (I had met him 
twice before.)
I told Dietzen that the presentation that AGENCY.COM did in his panel was 
about Enron. 
(We had already discussed the project with Dietzen when he visited our 
Houston office.)
I told him that AGENCY.COM was not supposed to reveal any information 
concerning the 
project.
At this time I did not know that hard copies of the presentation were 
available. I told 
Dietzen that if they did become available that the portion about EnronOnline 
should not 
be distributed.
Dietzen said he was not aware of the problem with discussing the project. He 
apologized 
and said he would not distribute any handouts if he received them.
Sometime later on Wednesday I went to the rack of presentation handouts and 
there was 
one available for the above mentioned session.
I do not know how long they were available (and I don't think Dietzen did 
either).
There were only 2 or 3 copies left and I took all of them. (BEA usually put 
out many 
copies in the rack so I don't know how many were actually picked up.)
The hard copies are PowerPoint printouts that include room for notes so the 
slides are 
very small making it difficult to read.
When the slides were shown on the screen during the session they were very 
clear.

Also, during some of the sessions (not the one where AGENCY.COM presented) I 
attended 
there was some question about the availability of the handouts and someone 
from BEA would 
answer something about the web.
I assumed that at some point in the near future they might be making copies 
of the 
presentations available on the BEA web site.
I will try to confirm this tomorrow (Thursday).
I checked the web site a few minutes ago and the presentations are not there. 

I will followup with any more details if I remember something else or if 
there are any 
further developments.

through legal.  However, we were able to ""get between"" a few deals and make 
some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 
8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold 
to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not 
enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with 
the customers.

Alan-

Attached hereto, are marked-up copies of the following ISDA documents (based 
on the US versions) which have been prepared using the credit worksheet for 
The Mitsui Marine & Fire Insurance Co., Limited, in conjunction with B&M:

ISDA Schedule,
CSA and
Enron Corp. Guarantee.

The footnotes will disappear when the changes to the document are accepted.  
It will be relatively straight forward to revise these for other 
counterparties
such as IBJ and Sanwa, which apparently have the same credit rating.  I note 
that we have not yet received the credit work sheet for IBJ or Sanwa.

Please note:

1.  There are still a number of ""options"" in the documents which I have not 
completed as I am unsure as to the desired outcome.  These are indicated in 
square
brackets.  Please let me know how you would like to deal with these;

2.   It will be important to make sure that the documents are carefully 
checked to ensure that we have properly incorporated the various elections in 
the documents;

3.   The agreements are governed by New York law and we should ensure that 
appropriate counsel reviews same;and

4.   A number of features in the agreements (particularly the requirement for 
a legal opinion and the use of L/Cs as form of collateral) are not common in
Japan and are likely to meet resistance from our counterparties.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

2,"Bill:  I have previously discussed this issue with Rod.  I would like to 
revisit once again.  These transactions include swaps/options/forwards on ENE 
stock.  There is a renewed effort coming from Treasury to use these tools 
more frequently than in the past.  I am in touch with Rex Rogers (Enron Corp. 
securities lawyer) as registration rights issues on ENE stock are definitely 
involved.  Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to 
Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.  At a minimun, 
even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty 
capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each 
confirmation as ISSUER OF THE STOCK (and ENA cannot make those agreements on 
behalf of Enron Corp.).

I would like to discuss ASAP as we are in the midst of negotiations with CSFB

US FERC To Order Sweeping Changes For Calif Pwr Market

U.S. to Decide Action on State Energy Crisis Utilities: Regulators today will

Los Angeles Times, 11/01/00


USA: US FERC probe finds no Calif. market abuse by utilities.

11/01/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on 
Wednesday said in a report that California utilities were not necessarily to 
blame for last summer's price rises, which led to an unravelling of the 
state's move to deregulate retail power markets. 
A FERC staff investigation, which was to be released in full later on 
Wednesday, found California's market structure and rules ""flawed,"" which 
combined with tight supplies caused the price of electricity to rise to 
record highs in both wholesale and retail markets.
FERC has proposed rule changes to fix the operations of the California 
Independent System Operator (ISO) and Power Exchange (PX). The draft changes 
would eliminate the need for Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and 
Electric and SoCal Edison from having to sell into or buy from the power 
exchange. 
Other highlights from the proposal include establihshing an independent, 
non-stakeholder to oversee the ISO and PX; modifying the auction market; new 
reporting requirements; and accelerating new siting of power generation 
facilities and eliminating some environmental impediments to new plants. 
If approved by the full commission at its Wednesday meeting, the changes 
would become effective in 60 days. California regulators and industry 
officials have until Nov. 22 to comment on FERC's proposed changes.

US FERC To Order Sweeping Changes For Calif Pwr Market

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Wednesday proposed sweeping structural changes for California's 
problem-plague power market. 
The commission proposed the changes in response to a staff investigation 
report, unveiled Wednesday, which found no ""smoking gun"" evidence that power 
sellers in the state had manipulated market prices to financial benefit.
Instead, FERC blamed the state's mandated market structure for the 
electricity supply shortages and spiking wholesale power prices passed on to 
retail customers in San Diego. 
At the same time, utilities elsewhere in the state hemorrhaged hundreds of 
millions of dollars due to a state-mandated rate freeze that required them to 
sell power at below cost.

U.S. to Decide Action on State Energy Crisis Utilities: Regulators today will 
release plans for tackling electricity costs. Potential solutions include

The fate of California's rocky experiment in electricity deregulation hangs 
in the balance today as federal regulators meet to decide whether to 
intercede in the state's dysfunctional $23-billion energy market or to let 
free-market forces continue to wreak havoc. 
The four-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will release a 
long-awaited staff report analyzing the root causes of California's energy 
crisis and, more important, issue a draft order or action plan on how to 
solve the problems of runaway wholesale electricity costs.
During public hearings in San Diego in September, FERC Chairman James J. 
Hoecker promised that the commission would take action and ""do whatever it 
takes"" to repair California's electricity market, whose deregulation was set 
in motion by landmark state legislation in September 1996. 
Just what the report and order will say remained a matter of intense 
speculation on the eve of their release. The FERC commissioners could impose 
new price caps or order an overhaul of the California Power Exchange and the 
Independent System Operator, the state agencies that conduct daily auctions 
for electricity. The commissioners may ask the state to undertake new 
initiatives to foster more competition in a retail power market still 
dominated by the three big investor-owned utilities. 
But an indictment of power generation companies--which some in the state 
accuse of ""gaming,"" or manipulating the system to wield unfair ""market power"" 
and wringing excessive profits from customers--is unlikely, according to 
published reports and state industry principals and government officials. 
The FERC commissioners are said to blame market deficiencies and defects in 
California for a supply-demand imbalance that sent wholesale electricity 
prices skyrocketing in July to an average of 12.9 cents a kilowatt-hour, more 
than triple the July 1999 average of 3.9 cents. A typical residential 
customer of San Diego Gas & Electric, the first state utility to fully 
deregulate, saw his or her bills triple before state legislators stepped in 
to cap retail rates in August. 
Just as worrisome to many observers is that wholesale electricity rates 
remain sky-high today, even after the end of peak summer power demand. 
Wholesale rates in October averaged about 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, double 
the average cost a year ago, said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the 
Independent System Operator. 
In any case, billions of dollars of investments as well as the political 
careers of prominent California politicians could be affected by what FERC 
does. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is coming out from Washington to 
hold a news conference with Gov. Gray Davis in Sacramento this morning to 
announce new, unspecified initiatives to address California's electricity 
problems. 
The Davis administration has gone on record demanding that FERC, which 
oversees the transmission and wholesale selling of electricity around the 
country, to step in and discharge its legal duty to restore ""just and fair"" 
electricity rates in California. The ballooning of electricity rates in San 
Diego during the summer created a political firestorm that raged unabated 
until the state Legislature imposed its caps. 
Rates paid by retail customers in the Southern California Edison and Pacific 
Gas & Electric coverage areas are frozen as well for the time being. But $5 
billion in ""undercollections""--the difference between what the investor-owned 
utilities have paid for wholesale electricity this year and what they can 
charge consumers--looms overhead, worrying Wall Street. 
""I have no idea what the FERC will say,"" said state Public Utilities 
Commission President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee who says she is as much 
in suspense as anyone. ""But we are expecting a substantial order that would 
move the ball forward on repairing the wholesale market in California."" 
Consumer advocates and the state's major utilities would like to see FERC 
impose some sort of wholesale price controls--even gut the Power Exchange and 
the Independent System Operator because they are clearly not working as 
intended. 
""We expect some radical surgery,"" said Doug Kline, spokesman for Sempra 
Energy, the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric. 
Some consumer groups would like to see FERC declare the wholesale rates 
collected by generators ""unjust and unreasonable,"" legal code words that 
would open the gates to actions by the PUC or the Legislature to force the 
power companies to disgorge or refund excessive profit. Such an action, which 
would lead to litigation by the power companies, is considered unlikely. 
Business interests, including the power generators that have reaped enormous 
profit from the dysfunctional market, are arguing to let free-market forces 
prevail because restrictive price caps would abort the market's evolution and 
possibly stifle construction of new power plants, which offer the best 
long-term solution to the state's predicament. 
""We expect that the FERC will find that the high prices of this past summer 
are a result of supply-and-demand imbalance and market design defects on the 
retail and wholesale side, but that the market participants have been playing 
within the rules and that there has been no manipulation or gaming,"" said 
Brent Bailey, general counsel of Duke Energy North America of Houston, a 
major generation player in the California market. 
Duke and others also strenuously oppose a solution proposed by the state's 
municipal utilities, notably the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power: 
that the industry in essence be re-regulated by imposing a system of 
cost-based rate controls, similar to how electricity rates were set before 
deregulation. 
Such a move would lead to lawsuits filed by Duke and other power merchants 
alleging ""confiscatory"" actions by the state nullifying the value of hundreds 
of millions of dollars they have invested in California power plants. Bailey 
favors temporary price caps until the market regains its balance, as well as 
new tweaking of the power market to stir up competition. 
Los Angeles DWP General Manager S. David Freeman, who has led calls for 
temporary imposition of cost-based rates, said California's failed 
deregulation experiment raises the possibility that electricity is 
intrinsically an ""un-deregulatable"" service. 
""Three years ago, I thought it would work. Then we had a train wreck,"" he 
said. ""I'm not committing heresy when I say that I think it may not work out.""

In the context of the SFA audit and also your request for info about this 
some time ago (apologies for the delay), I've done some research into our 
current practice and procedure on taping and the position is as follows:

The current policy is to destroy recordings after 6 months.
However, this policy is not being implemented by our Telecoms group at the 
moment which is awaiting confirmation that the 6 month period is appropriate 
(not clear why).  
It appears that no recordings have been destroyed for at least 2 years.
A firm has been contracted to destroy recordings as soon as the go-ahead is 
given.

Obviously we want to be consistent across jurisdictions and I wanted to check 
with you that the retention period in Houston is still 6 months.  Please 
confirm.

Also, John Sherriff is keen for traders to be given guidance on what not to 
say on recorded lines, perhaps with some case studies to provide a salutary 
lesson or two!  Have you guys done anything similar in the US?

I look forward to hearing form you. 

Thanks and regards

Title: Demand, Prices to Follow Trajectory of the Economy 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2702;


***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGY--POWER AND GAS PRICES AND VOLATILITY EXPECTED TO FALL

CERA expects a weaker US economy to be one of the outcomes of the tragic events 
on September 11, 2001, which will further reduce the demand for gas and power. 
Spot prices for natural gas and power already reflect this expectation, and 
CERA's outlook anticipates continued price weakness. 

*  As new supplies continue to arrive over the next year, even as demand 
weakens, the West will have more than adequate supplies of gas and power.
 
*  This surplus supply situation will put additional downward pressure on 
prices.

*  The shift from supply tightness to the recent plunge in prices can be traced 
principally to the rapid decline in demand for both gas and power this year, 
while supplies grew.

2,Hey Jeff - What's the good word on Antibes? - Avram
2,"
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

2,"Dear Dr. McMullen,

A few weeks ago I received a call from your University
regarding employment opportunities at Enron.

I called back and summarized the  needs of my group (an ideal profile of a
candidate):

1. mathematical finance
2. computer programming (C, C++)
3. understanding of the energy markets

I shall appreciate any information about potential candidates.

I have also given some other suggestions regarding potential
opportunities for graduates with different profiles.

Please, feel free to call me. My number is 713 853 3848.

ber 2nd  edition, titled the Riskless Rebound portfolio, continues to climb=
 the charts. As of today's market close, the portfolio as a whole has now a=
ppreciated fully 36.75% over a brief two weeks. The Deutshce Bank Alex Brow=
n IPO Endwave Corporation (NASDAQ: ENWV) is leading the way, up 52% from $.=
84 to $1.28. The company came public on October 17, 2000 at $14 per share, =
and still has $1.78 per share in cash.   Readers will recall we computed th=
e portfolio would rise 88% if each of the five stocks simply appreciated to=
 the level of cash they had in the bank. Therefore, we believe there is con=
siderably more upside in this group of five stocks.   However, the NASDAQ m=
arket has rebounded dramatically off the September 21st lows, and is probab=
ly a little ahead of itself. Therefore, we would caution members who are lo=
oking for good entry levels to wait for a correction sometime between now a=
nd the end of the year before entering or adding to positions. If such a pu=
llback occurs, we will try to help you choose a good entry level.   To view=

0,"Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

0,"Attached for your information is a joint petition for modification of the
1998 Revenue Adjustment Proceeding (""RAP"") decision filed today by SCE, PG&E
and SDG&E.  The utilities request that, on an expedited basis, the
Commission limit the scope of the PX Credit audit which WPTF obtained in a
negotiated settlement in the 1998 RAP proceeding to remaining year 2000
calculations and thereafter order that the audit be terminated.  They state
that the audit is both irrelevant and costly and that ""common sense demands""
the Commission reconsider the decision.

They ask that comments in opposition be filed by August 3, reply comments on
August 10 and a Commission decision at its meeting scheduled for August 23.
They also ask the Commission to waive the period provided in Rule 77.7 for
comments and reply comments on a draft decision in order that the decision
become final immediately.

The filing states that there have been dramatic changes in energy markets,
the number of DA customers has declined significantly and that ratepayers
should not have to pay for the audit.  Of course, they don't mention that
the reason for the decline in DA customers is their own failure to pay the
PX Credit.  It is instead attributed to the ""dysfunctional restructuring
scheme and concommitant rise in wholesale energy prices.""  They justify
their request legally by stating that their filing demonstrates that there
are ""significant new facts"" and a ""material change in conditions.""  The
third criteria for reopening or modifying a Commission decision, a basic
misconception of law or fact by the Commission, is not alleged to have
occurred.

They also state that DA penetration will continue to decline because
""Assembly Bills X1-1 and X1-6 have effectively reregulated the market.""

Attached to the filing are declarations from the three ESP members of the
Audit Committee, Bob Anderson of APSES,  Aaron Thomas of AES NewEnergy and
Marilynn Semro of Seattle City Light Department, in support of the
utilities' petition.  I have not reviewed the specific wording changes to
the RAP decision to determine if there are any problems with the proposed
modifications.

Working in the main office isnt as much fun as working in Portland.    There is a good chance that I will return to PDX, as there are so many good people there and so much to do outdoors. 
So, tell me what you are doing now in Phoenix.    Everyone that I've met from SRP has been very nice,  (Perry,  John Sullivan,  etc.).   Hope you enjoy working there and all is well with your family.

Subject: Pueblo

Here's a weird one.  Could we structure the Pueblo pipeline project with the 
following characteristics: 
1.  The lateral from TW's mainline to Albeq. is wholly TW owned (i.e., no 
joint venture with Langley);
2.  The lateral  is 100% debt financed (i.e., it is expected to cost about 
$20 million, which TW would borrow in a project financing, secured by the 
revenue stream under the firm contract for service on the new lateral);
3.  TW files for a 7(c) certificate, seeking an incremental rate for service 
on the new lateral;  Any service on the TW mainline will be subject to TW's 
existing rates;
4.  TW designs the max. incremental rate based on normal cap. structure, 
deprec., O&M, allocations, etc.
5.  TW has one contract for 40,000/day, for 10 years for service on the 
lateral;
6.   The rate for that one customer is a negotiated rate that is based on an 
alternative ratemaking study under which the customer pays enough $$ to cover 
debt service on the project financing, incremental deprec., O&M, A&G, etc.  
No allocated costs or any other costs related to TW's preexisting facilities 
are included in the negotiated rate.  
7.  TW is entirely at risk for cost recovery, but the one contract covers all 
actual costs, except return and taxes on the new line. Basically, the one 
contract locks in a floor of break even cash flow.  If TW fails to lock up 
any additional customers there will never be any ""taxable income"" for the 
line since debt servicing costs and other expenses completely eat up the 
revenue under the one big contract.  Therefore, there will never be any 
return or taxes related to the new line, unless TW locks up additional 
contracts.  
8.  Any additional contracts TW locks up will generate TW's upside for the 
project. 

The question is can we do this?  Will FERC let us build it?  Will FERC let us 
oversize the pipeline significantly larger than the 40,000/day that the one 
big firm customer needs?   I'm sure I've left out important facts, so I'll 
try to grab you tomorrow to discuss.  

The overall objective is to create the ""leanest"" possible initial cost 
structure for the pipeline, and therefore for the Langley power plant, 
consistent with TW being able to get the new pipeline built.  I.e., lets get 
the pipe built and help the power plant get to a cheap enough elec. rate that 
they can get their big contract with the govt.  and economically sell surplus 
off-peak power onto the grid.  Even if the new incremental rate for service 
on the lateral is a break even rate, TW's upside comes from incremental 
throughput from the Permian to the new lateral, at a rate of $___/MMBtu, and 
from any additional bypass load we can pick up from PNM (it looks like TW's 
rates off of the new line will beat PNM's industrial rates).   

I appreciate your input on this.  DF

2,"We all knew about this concept--its Danny's ""Newco"" idea.  The only thing 
that is new is they finally decided on a name and got the paperwork for the 
new corporate entity out of the Corporate Secretary's office.  I knew about 
the name a couple weeks ago.  As far as I know, no one has signed off on any 
particular transaction or on a procedure to follow when ""Mavrix"" starts 
transacting business.  We all better understand at that point that this may 
be a ""lose lose"" deal--if Mavrix makes a ton of money, everyone will come 
after it (as soon as they find out) and claim we arre playing games with 
confidential information if Mavrix is trading capacity on the Enron pipes.  
If Mavrix loses money, tough cookie--there's no way to plow the losses back 
into some regulated entity.  It is probably now time to have a prayer meeting 
with Danny, Steve, and probably Stan, just to make sure everyone knows what 
we all think about the risks before they charge off and start doing deals.

Subject: Re: Mavrix  

I thought the officers had discussed this with Danny quite some time ago, as 
the organization of the company was set in motion in early Dec.

Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp. has been organized as a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of ETS for the purpose of transportation capacity management.  The 
officers are the same as the slate of officers of Transwestern.   The company 
will neither buy or sell gas nor use transportation capacity.  However, it 
does plan to enter into natural gas transportation contracts (and resell the 
capacity thru capacity release).  That is why the creditworthiness question 
has come up.
I really don't have any information so send you, unless you want to see the 
organizational documents.  Steve Harris can answer any business-related 
questions you have.  Or, I'll be happy to try to answer any other questions.

Subject: Mavrix

Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp., which is a subsidiary of ETS, needs to 
satisfy TW's creditworthiness requirements in order to enter into a 
transportation agreement with TW.  Paul Cherry has suggested that Northern 
Natural Gas issue a guarantee.  Please let me know whether you think this 
would be acceptable.  If Mavrix wanted to hold NNG capacity, TW could issue 
the guarantee.

Mitch - Whether or not we qualify to even apply for an NPDES permit is 
contingent upon the results of the mercury sampling. If the Mercury 
concentration is greater than 12 ppt, we can not apply for a permit. This is 
a very low threshold and it is likely that we are not going to meet it. The 
sampling was done last week, but the results are not out yet. If the results 
show that we can meet the mercury limit, we still need to assess the cost of 
building a 3-mile pipeline to the white river. We have not yet given 
authorization to do this study. Ross Newlin is taking the lead on this.

If everything goes well, we may be able to submit an application by middle of 
December at the earliest.

Protocol for CEMS approval - CEMS must be installed, certified, and quality 
assured as per the acid rain requirements contained in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 75. The process involves performing a series of 
initial tests, including Relative accuracy test audits (RATAs), linearity 
checks, cycle/response time checks, and calibration drifts.  It also involves 
significant recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

Rick, have we been able to come up with a summary sheet on the performance 
tests?

>  b.  Confirm that all warranties are in name of LLC or transferable
> to LLC.
Stuart, this one is probably more in your bag. I would suggest that we state, 
all bidders should assume that warranties will be placed in the LLC's name 
prior to closing and that all warranties are fully transferable.  (Note that 
currently, the warranties are not in the LLC's name, but are in ENA's name).

>  c.  What is the protocol for CEMS approval.
Gus, can you take a stab at this one?

>  d.  Provide water quality test results.
Don, this should now be in the DD room.

>  e.  Provide all outage reports.
Rick/Brent, do we have all of these?  Any problem with providing them?

>  f.   Provide overhaul budgeting.
Don, not yet developed.  Overhaul budgeting will be completed as any 
scheduled overhaul reaches the near-term horizon.  Our method of budgeting 
for overhauls is to accrue maintenance dollars for every start (approx $1500 
per start).  We continually re-evaluate whether we are starts based or hours 
based.  Currently, we remain starts based maintenance.

>  g.  Provide copy of application for discharge permit.
Application has not yet been submitted.  We have only entered initial 
discussions with the state.  We will submit the application once developed - 
- currently expected by xxxxx date (Gus, please verify this is true).

Burton accuses Davis of veto talk=20
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 13, 2001)=20
State Senate leader John Burton charged Tuesday that Gov. Gray Davis=20
threatened lawmakers earlier this week in an attempt to gain support for a=
=20
struggling deal with Southern California Edison.=20
While answering questions on the Edison deal, Burton alleged that Davis=20
suggested he would veto non-energy legislation if Senate Democrats did not=
=20
back a deal he struck with Edison in April.=20
Davis aides denied the charge, as did some lawmakers, but the episode=20
suggested that support for the governor's plan remains distant.=20
Davis met Monday with 13 senators as part of an ongoing lobbying effort for=
=20
the Edison deal. Under Davis' tentative agreement, the state would pay the=
=20
utility $2.76 billion for its transmission lines and dedicate a portion of=
=20
electricity rates to help pay off its debts. The deal requires legislative=
=20
approval.=20
Burton said he was not invited to the Monday meeting. His claims were based=
=20
on reports from colleagues, he said.=20
The Senate leader said the governor told senators that their past support f=
or=20
his proposals ""didn't mean anything if they voted against this.""=20
""If that turns out to be the case,"" Burton said, ""I've been around long=20
enough to know how to play that game with the executive branch as well.""=20
""He's too smart to do that,"" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio, referring=
=20
to alleged threats. ""I think he expressed his strong support for the=20
legislation, but he's too smart to do that.""=20
Three senators who attended the meeting with Davis disagreed with Burton's=
=20
characterization. One declined comment; others did not return telephone cal=
ls=20
on the subject.=20
""I heard no threats in anything (Davis) said,"" said Sen. Sheila Kuehl,=20
D-Santa Monica. ""He said, 'Look, I want my bill to go up for a vote.' And w=
e=20
said, 'As it stands, we're not sure how much support it has.' ""=20
Two months after the Edison deal was first unveiled, most lawmakers have=20
rejected it as written. Leaders in both houses are discussing various=20
alternatives to the governor's plan, which is contained in legislation by=
=20
Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles.=20
""As it is before us, it is nothing more than a bailout for the utilities,""=
=20
Burton said.=20
He reiterated Tuesday that he wants to see generators and creditors take a =
30=20
percent cut in the debt they are owed for energy purchases. He is supportiv=
e=20
of a plan that would shift costs to big energy consumers and protect=20
residents.=20
Burton also unveiled three new energy proposals Tuesday. One would require=
=20
the California Energy Commission to provide backup power for high-priority=
=20
traffic signals. Another would prevent a 10 percent rate increase scheduled=
=20
to take effect next year. The third is a resolution that would support the=
=20
governor in seizing power plants.=20
""We're going to show him that there is support in the Senate for seizing=20
these power plants from these generators who, in fact, have been ripping us=
=20
off,"" Burton said.=20
Discussions on the governor's Edison proposal could begin as soon as next=
=20
week. Three Senate committees -- judiciary, energy and natural resources --=
=20
are likely to take up the bill.=20
Maviglio said that the governor remains open to changes to the deal -- a=20
compromise Davis will have to make given that few lawmakers are willing to=
=20
support the existing plan.=20
""I don't think there's a lot of support for (the deal) as it is, in every=
=20
aspect now,"" Kuehl said. ""But I would say that among my colleagues, there i=
s=20
support for purchasing some assets in exchange for enabling Edison to come=

This past Wednesday eveing, the cocktail party in honor of the National
Audubon Society=01,s Living Ocean, held at the home of W. Graham Arader III=
 at
1016 Madison Avenue, was a stellar event, drawing a crowd and raising
awareness.  The focus of the event was the launching of the =01&Just Ask=01=
8
campaign, aimed at protecting the creatures of the sea by expanding consume=
r
awareness about food from the ocean.  Attendees sampled delicious recipes
from some of the top US chefs, all of whom used fish recommended by the
=01&Seafood Lover=01,s Almanac,=018 a beautifully designed, whimsical guide=
 to fish
and shellfish that serves to help consumers become more familiar with the
seafood they eat.
.
Edited by Ms. Mercedes Lee (with Suzanne Iudicello and Dr. Safina
contributing), the Seafood Lover=01,s Almanac provides readers with crucial
information regarding sea life: what is safe to eat, for example, and which
species are endangered.  Many seafoods commonly available today are much
less plentiful than the average consumer might think.  Consumers hold the
greatest influence over the buying decisions of seafood wholesalers and
retailers, and with the efforts of the National Audubon Society this issue
will have a much greater chance of receiving widespread attention.

America=01,s top seafood chefs (and their spectacular creations) were in
attendance, including Rick Moonen, of Oceana, New York; Todd English,
Kingfish Hall, Boston; Jonathan Eismann, Pacific Time, Miami; Robert
Kinkead, Kinkead=01,s, Washington, D.C.; and Terence Feury, Striped Bass,
Philadelphia.  The sampling of food ranged from Margarita Oysters to
Dungeness Crabcakes with Chipotle Vinaigrette, Sesame Seared Tuna with
seaweed salad, pickled ginger, wasabe and fried wontons, all served up in a=
n
irresistible fashion.  Best of all, the chefs generously shared their
recipes to all who whished to recreate these delicious appetizers at home.

Other notable guests included Jennifer Bogo, Associate Editor for The
Environment Magazine; Barbara Fairchild, Editor and Chief of Bon Appetite;
Mindy Fox of the Earth Pledge Foundation; Jennifer Herman of Martha Stewart
Magazine; Ray Isle, Senior Editor of Wine & Spirits; James Rodewald, Senior
Editor of Gourmet; and of course, Graham Arader, a long time supporter of
the Audubon Society, who would not have missed the event for the world.

The evening was permeated by celebration and enthusiasm for the new =01&Jus=
t
Ask=018 campaign: a wonderful sign that support for the Audubon Society and=
 all
of its fundamental projects continues to grow.  Please do not hesitate to
contact us if you would like information on how you can make a contribution
to the invaluable efforts of the National Audubon Society.

Latest NFL Player News

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1236&> , WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01
Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1859&> , WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/28/01
A banged-up Smith Toe/knee) will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback. 

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay. Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/28/01
Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day."" 

Doug Brien <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1393&>, K IND - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the c! lu! b wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/28/01
According to the Pro Football News and Injury Report, Green has asthma, but he has practiced fully this week and will start against the Vikings. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/27/01
Thrash is listed as questionable with an ankle injury, but he is expected to play against the Giants. 

Patrick Jeffers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1515&> , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 12/27/01
Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/27/01
The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday. If he cannot practice fully on Thursday, Spergon Wynn will get the start this week.

Brian said the deal was done with Chris to use Enron's IPP. This has been 
scheduled.

TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS 
contracts. TCO could do an inground storage transfer between Enron and these 
accounts, however storage withdrawal and injection fees would be charged.

Per my other e-mail... we are on target in getting the total gas withdrawn 
from storage for  March. There is no need to do outside deals to get 
additional storage gas out of the ground. If you do outside deals, this just 
changes the amount of storage that goes to Choice.

Thanks.

Let's plan to get together.  Maybe you'll come over to our humble little pad

I am sorry I didn't invite you to the wedding, Jeff.  I was going to and
then changed my mind when you seemed so stressed and hassled by your

didn't want to.  I should have asked you your preference.  I hope you

I'm so glad you're okay, relatively speaking.  You're a great guy, Jeff, and
I hope that this experience helps you and me and everybody around us to
focus on what's actually important in our lives, and to be especially kind
to each other.

A DASH will be circulating later today for approximately $16MM for $10MM of 
progress payments on a 7FA and certain development costs for our Longview 
Project.  Chip Schneider and I have agreed that this approach allows us to 
get to NTP on the project (up until August 20), or determine a higher-valued 
use for the turbine in the event the development does not get finalized for 
some reason.  Given the strength of the PNW market, this project is in the 
money using Enron mid curves for gas and power.  

Mike Miller has appropriately backed away - my team is engaged directly with 
GE on the contract negotiation and a term sheet is expected to be signed 
tomorrow.
I am highly confident that this will result in a 2001 gain of $15MM-$20MM.   

I was planning to talk with Louise about this at our call this morning.  Are 
you or she the appropriate signor for EA?  I will also contact Mark Frevert 
early this afternoon to discuss.   

Regards,

Chris

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego 
Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, 
overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity 
service. 
On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy 
Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), 
AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class 
action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. 
The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A 
news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday 
morning in San Diego.
Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is 
active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate 
contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back 
into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold 
in the state. 
An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable 
to comment. 
The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply 
last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used 
real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. 
The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion 
for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason

3,"Following up on our discussion yesterday, this is to summarize the issues and 
questions that we identified with respect to the trading of credit 
derivatives through Enron OnLine:

1.  The proposal needs to be analyzed more closely from the perspective of 
three principal regulatory schemes - securities, commodities and insurance.  
If the credit derivatives are not priced on the basis of or indexed to 
securities, there should not be any significant securities law issues.  With 
respect to the Commodity Exchange Act, if the derivatives are executed as 
swaps, they will need to satisfy the CFTC's swap exemption and, if executed 
as options, they will need to satisfy the trade option exemption.  With 
respect to insurance, there could be an issue as to whether the credit 
derivatives constitute insurance.  This determination as well will depend 
largely on how the derivatives are structured.  For example, how will payment 
amounts be determined and will payments be tied to losses actually 
experienced  by a counterparty?

2.  As a result of the foregoing, it will be necessary to obtain more details 
regarding the structure of the proposed transactions.  Will they be swaps or 
options?  What will the precise terms be (and are there any draft forms of 
confirms that can be reviewed)?

3.  It will also be necessary to determine how bankruptcy events will be 
defined.  This approach is clearly simpler than other forms of credit 
derivatives that include a variety of triggers (such as those based on 
defaults under loans, derivatives, securities or other instruments), because 
bankruptcy should generally be a public and objective event.  However, in 
many jurisdictions, it is  possible for third parties to cause an involuntary 
bankruptcy proceeding to be commenced and even frivolous proceedings can be 
commenced and maintained for some period.  Presumably the definition that is 
used will need to provide for some period in which the proceeding might be 
dismissed.  Also, the definition will need to take into account the 
possibility of non-US bankruptcy proceedings.

4.  We also should obtain more information on the manner in which the 
derivatives will be priced and the manner in which such prices will be 
published or disseminated to clients.  This goes to the issue of whether 
Enron could be found to have breached some duty to a third party or whether 
that party may have a claim against Enron on some other basis.

For example, it is possible that an entity whose ""name"" is included in the 
list of those on which derivatives are written will claim that Enron 
improperly used confidential information that it received about that party 
through a trading relationship in pricing derivatives on its credit.  In 
addition, such ""name"" might claim that Enron caused it injury by publishing a 
price for derivatives on its credit that reflected a weaker credit rating 
than was warranted.  That party might claim that, by publishing such price, 
Enron caused other parties to suspend trading with it, to declare defaults or 
to demand collateral.  This obviously is not generally a problem with credit 
derivatives because they are done privately on a one-to-one basis.

Please call us if you have any questions or would like to discuss these or 
other issues further.  Best regards.

The F/M relief sited may not apply in all instances because technically we 
may have failed to preserve our rights by not notifying Furnas for 6 months.  
They have responded as such although they have not assessed any penalties to 
date.  The real test is may 4 when we are supposed to be in Phase 3 on Gas.

Subject: Re: Period after commissioning on oil - PPA availability penalties 
vs. diesel cost exposure  

Pete,

 There are two types of penalties under the PPA for the account of EPE (the 
latter can be used as a hedge to diesel cost exposure and we don't have any 
penalties right now)

(1) Delay penalties in being unable to provide the guaranteed capacity of 480 
MW on gas starting May 4, 2001 (this is where the Force Majeure extension is 
able to provide relief). The penalties here are calculated as R$ 400 per 
delayed MW per day. 

(2) Penalties due to capacity shortfall (basically - are we able to meet 
dispatch requests). If the moving average of the monthly average of the 
projects equivalent availability, calculated in accordance with provisions of 
annex-7 of the PPA, is less than 92%, a penalty shall be assessed in the 
amount of monthly capacity portion of the tariff for each phase times the 
guaranteed capacity for the phase multiplied by (92% - moving average of the 
monthly availability).

Penalties type (1) does not apply in the concept analyzed as it relates to 
delay in gas (Force Majeure Claim issue). 

Refusing a dispatch request above 220 MW has an impact on penalties type (2) 
(guaranteed capacity is 300 MW). Given that the plant currently has a moving 
average of the monthly availability of about 99.7%, there is a margin built 
up that can be used to accept an availability hit by refusing a dispatch 
request above 220 MW. Therefore, to avoid the huge fuel costs associated with 
being dispatched above 220 MW, the PPA availability penalty concept can be 
utilized as an alternative. If we continue to decline to be dispatched above 
220 MW for a long period however, the built up margin will be reduced and 
eventually we'll have to pay penalties because the 12-month moving average 
moves below 92%.

Please let me know if additional questions

Christiaan

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

James O'Keefe"

Lawmakers seek to oust three PSC members

Rep. Dennis Bonner (D., District 51) and Sen. Ronnie DePasco (D.,
District 11) are trying to oust three members of the Public Service
Commission who refused to hold a public hearing before the PSC approved
a Missouri Gas Energy application to raise its rates by 44%.  Bonner
filed a resolution in the House yesterday afternoon seeking the removal
of the commissioners, and DePasco plans to file an identical resolution
in the Senate today, Bonner told TR.

The 44% rate hike was ""ridiculous,"" Bonner told TR.  ""People in my
district can't afford to pay that.""  Bonner said, however, that he
""would have been happy if [the commissioners] would have held a
hearing.""  Bonner said he and DePasco had warned the PSC in advance that
they would try to expel any commissioners who approved the rate hike
request without holding a public hearing first.

The three commissioners who voted in favor of the rate increase were
Chairwoman Sheila Lumpe and Commissioners Connie Murray and M. Dianne
Drainer.  Bonner and DePasco aren't trying to remove commissioners
Kelvin Simmons and Robert Schemenauer, who voted against the rate
increase.

MONTANA
House unanimously approves Uniform Electronic Transactions Act

The House has approved overwhelmingly a Uniform Electronic Transaction
Act to prohibit anyone from denying legal effect or enforceability to a
record or signature solely because it's in electronic form.  (1/19/01
a.m.)  Secretary of State Mike Cooney (D.) requested HB 234, which was
sponsored officially by Rep. Bob Lawson (R., District 80).

Each government agency would be able to determine whether and to what
extent it would send and accept electronic records and electronic
signatures.  Government agencies, however, wouldn't be limited to any
specific types of technologies.

HB 234 also states that electronic signatures would be valid only if all
parties agreed to conduct a transaction electronically.  If a party
agreed to conduct one transaction by electronic means, the party could
refuse to conduct other transactions electronically.  This right to opt
out of electronic transactions couldn't be waived.

HB 234 awaits consideration by the Senate Business and Labor Committee.

ALTERNATIVE REGULATION
MONTANA
Lawmakers to examine price cap regulation

State lawmakers will be considering a bill to allow telecom carriers to
opt out of rate-of-return regulation if they accept price cap
regulation.  LC 655, which awaits introduction, states that a local
exchange carrier's (LEC's) election to accept price cap regulation would
be irrevocable.  Qwest Corp. proposed the bill's language, the
legislative staff told TR.  Sen. Fred Thomas (R., District 31) requested
the measure.

LB 655 would set a LEC's price caps at the permanent rates last
authorized by the Public Service Commission for the company before it
elected to come under the new regulatory structure.  The price floors
would be set at total-service long-run incremental cost.

The new prices set under the price cap regulation would be indefinite;
no specific time reference is included in the draft bill.  The PSC
wouldn't be able to change the price caps unless changes were needed to
reflect a new tax or fee.  The prices also could change to allow a LEC
to recover the additional cost of providing a new telecom service or the
expense of a new or expanded program, such as an extended area service
region.

Additionally, the prices could change if the LEC filed an application
with the PSC and justified a change in a price cap.  The commission
would have 60 days to act on the application.

If a complaint were filed by a consumer or consumer counsel regarding
the company's prices and the PSC found the company had violated the
provisions of this measure, the commission would have the authority to
order the LEC to comply with the measure.  The draft bill is available
at http://data.opi.state.mt.us/bills/2001/lchtml/LC0655.htm.

IOWA
Bill aims to provide equal treatment for cable TV companies

Sen. Mary Lundby (R., District 26) has introduced SF 47 to require a
city granting more than one cable TV franchise to make the terms and
conditions of the additional franchise no more favorable and no less
burdensome than those of the existing franchise agreement.

Terms and conditions would include the territorial extent of the
franchise; system design; technical performance standards; construction
schedule; performance bonds; standards for construction and installation
of cable TV facilities; service to subscribers; public, government, and
educational access channels and programming; liability and
indemnification; and franchise fees.

If the terms or conditions of any additional franchise were more
favorable or less burdensome than the terms or conditions of any
existing cable TV franchise, the more favorable or less burdensome terms
or conditions also would apply for any existing cable TV franchise.

SF 47 has been referred to the Senate Commerce Committee.

ILLINOIS
ICC seeks extension of 10-digit dialing in Chicago area

The state Commerce Commission yesterday asked the FCC to extend a waiver
it granted to the commission to delay implementation of 10-digit dialing
in the Chicago metropolitan area until April 1.

On Jan. 17 North American Numbering Plan administrator (NANPA) NeuStar,
Inc., informed the ICC that the last NXX code in the ""847"" area code had
been assigned and that the first NXX code in the ""224"" ""overlay"" would
be assigned in 30 days.  Activation would occur 90 days thereafter.

Assuming that NANPA is correct, and that there are no NXX codes in the
847 NPA that should be returned, activation of the first code in the 225
NPA may occur on or after May 17, the ICC said..  It said its success
forestalling exhaustion of the five Chicago codes may cause the
temporary waiver to expire before activation of a single new NXX code in
the 224 overlay or any other Chicago area code.  (CC docket 96-98)

WIRELESS
HAWAII
Bill targets drivers' use of handheld wireless phones

Rep. K. Mark Takai (D., District 34) has introduced HB 225 to make it
illegal to drive while talking on a handheld wireless phone.  Persons
convicted of using their wireless phones while driving would face a
maximum $100 fine for a first offense.  Violators could face a maximum
$200 fine for second offenses and a maximum $500 fine for any additional
offenses.

In addition to the fines, anyone caught violating the measure would be
required to attend a traffic safety class and pay a $50 driver
assessment fee.

HB 225 would provide exemptions for any drivers making ""911"" emergency
calls, reporting traffic accidents, or having a reason to fear for their
lives.  The bill awaits consideration by House Transportation Committee

Sen. Linda J. Melconian (D., Hampden) has introduced SB 400 to create a
nonprofit corporation called Mass211, Inc., to administer the
information and referral service established by the Department of
Telecommunications and Energy.

Last year the DTE ordered the abbreviated dialing code ""211"" to be
assigned to the service.  The service will refer callers to agencies
that deal with domestic violence, substance abuse, elder services,
crisis intervention, health care, housing, food and fuel donations,
support groups, family counseling, and a range of other health and human
services.  (5/22/00 a.m.)

The bill has been referred to the Government Regulations Committee.  Its
text is available at http://www.state.ma.us/legis/bills/st00400.htm.

Bills aim to protect consumer privacy

Legislators are considering three bills to enhance phone customers'
privacy.  Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky (D., District 86) has
introduced AB 1390 to prohibit the ""transmission of unsolicited bulk
electronic mail.""  The bill would establish criminal and civil penalties
to be assessed against violators of the proposed anti-spamming law.  AB
1390 has been referred to the Committee on Consumer Affairs and
Protection; its text is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01390.

Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer (D., District 67) has introduced AB 1668
to require local exchange carriers to provide, free of charge, unlisted
telephone numbers for victims of domestic violence.  The bill has been
referred to the Committee on Corporations.  Its text is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01669.

AB 1589, sponsored by Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr. (D., District 43),
aims to protect users of cordless and mobile phones against
eavesdropping.  The measure would prohibit the ""mechanical overhearing
of a conversation"" when the person ""overhearing the conversation knows
that it emanates"" from a cordless or mobile telephone.  The bill resides
in the Committee on Codes.  Its text is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01589.

PSC gives ALLTEL more time to comply with billing rules

The Public Service Commission has granted ALLTEL Missouri, Inc.'s
request for an extension until March 31 to comply with two new billing
rules.  The commission's order adopts an agreement reached by ALLTEL,
the commission staff, and the public counsel.

On Sept. 22, 2000, ALLTEL told the PSC it couldn't update fully its
billing program to accommodate the new rules until March 31 and asked
for an exemption until that time.  The billing rules went into effect at
the end of October 2000.

The agreement calls for ALLTEL to continue sending its traditional
notice of discontinuance until the company begins following a new rule
on ""discontinuance of service to residential customers.""  In addition,
the agreement requires ALLTEL to review manually each account for which
service is at risk of being disconnected until the company implements
the new billing rules.  The agreement also asked ALLTEL to continue
sending notices to customers who haven't paid their accounts.  The
notices must inform customers when they must pay to avoid losing
service.

The PSC's order is available at
http://www.psc.state.mo.us/orders/01231204.htm.

   Jeff and Greg:

   Echoing Jason's message from last week, we enjoyed

   meeting you very much.? With this email I would like

   to follow up on comments you made regarding a possible

   investment that would allow FairAir to serve in a

   market-making role.

   As detailed in the attached presentation, we propose

   that Enron invest $3.5 million for 17% of our company

   as the lead investor in a $6 million round.? These funds

   would let us deploy $2 million toward market-making

   and grow our business over 12 months to the point

   where we are generating $250k in monthly profits.

   (Our projections are detailed in the attached

   spreadsheet.)

   FairAir is the industry's best hope for the creation of

   a true travel market down the road.? Now that our system

   is operational, we are poised for growth.? As we discussed,

   Northwest has verbally committed to expanding from seven

   trial markets to their full route system.? Additionally,

   in direct conversations with American and Continental,

   we received a strong indication that an investment from

   Enron would tip the balance in our favor.

   I will call you the morning of Monday, March 26th to

   follow up on this email.

2:00 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000
 
After submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent 
agreements 
for firm transportation capacity, the highly contested Independence Pipeline 
and related 
SupplyLink pipeline projects were approved by FERC this morning. The two 
projects 
have been pending at FERC for more than three years.

The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas 
transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in 
Pennsylvania. 
The ""tentative"" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their 
downstream 
partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be 
operating 
a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and 
National 
Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an 
investment 
of about $1.5 billion.

The Commission approved the ""greenfield"" Independence project over 
significant 
opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they 
were not 
convinced the new precedent agreements provided ""sufficient evidence"" of 
market 
support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at 
least 35% 
of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26.

I understand you may be able to shed some light on this.  I have received a

The allegation is that his partner, Mr Buckey is diverting payments for gas 
purchased from  wells owned by Brown, Buckey and others.  The wells are 
described in the complaint as Rea #1 and #2 and Cullen #1 and $2 in 
Washington County, OH (Marietta).  ECT is named b/c ECT is buying the gas 
from the well and allegedly paying the wrong person for the gas (I can't see 
how that gives rise to any claim, but that's beside the point).

I can't find where EES is buying gas from this well, so that leaves you.  Is 
this ECT's gas?  MDS

"
1,"Marcello Fontana sent an article from this week's BusinessWeek on an 
apparently
succesful policy to promote growth.

ECONOMIC VIEWPOINT
'Bribe' Third World Parents to Keep Their Kids in School
GARY S. BECKER

        Many well-meaning Americans, including college students and religious
organizations, have attacked Nike Inc. and other companies accused of
using child labor in their overseas plants in poor nations. I agree that
something should be done to save the children from dismal long-term
economic prospects. However, effective policies must recognize that the
fundamental cause of child labor is poverty, not greedy foreign and
domestic employers. To combat the effects of poverty, poor mothers
should be ''bribed'' to keep their children in school longer.

        Really poor families in Brazil, Mexico, Zaire, India, and many other
nations put their children to work because their meager earnings help
provide basic food and medicine for themselves and younger siblings.
Although parents may recognize that schooling would improve their
children's marketable labor skills later in life, they cannot afford the
''luxury'' of taking them out of the labor market. In essence, child
labor is the result of a conflict between short-term parental economic
interests and the long-term interests of the children.

        Adequate economic growth always eliminates child labor even without
laws

against it. But poor nations needn't wait until they grow richer. There
are short-term solutions. Many nations have compulsory schooling laws up
to age 15 or so, but they are often hard to enforce, especially in rural
areas and poor sections of large cities. Families who want their
children to work simply do not send them to school, or the children have
very high absenteeism rates. Officials are reluctant to punish parents
of working children, perhaps because they recognize that the problem is
not selfishness but poverty.

        SHARE THE BURDEN. I propose a better way: Give parents a financial
incentive to keep their children in school longer. Poor mothers should
be paid if schools certify that their children attend classes regularly.
Parents would be strongly motivated to send their children to
school--even when the children do not want to go--if these payments were
not much below what the children could earn. Most poor parents would
happily continue.

        [A few sentences were cut here.  I think they describe Progresa 
program
in Mexico.  I think this program pays a few dozen dollars a month to families
that keep kids in school and immunized.]
Most poor Mexican families earn only about $100 a
month. That large a percentage increase should have a noticeable effect
on their behavior.

        Poor families in less developed nations whose children do go to school
are likely to withdraw their daughters when they become teenagers. This
tends to perpetuate economic inequalities, since the children of women
who receive little schooling also tend to be badly educated. Progresa
tries to combat this tendency to favor education of older sons by paying
a little more to families that keep teenage daughters enrolled.

        NARROW THE GAP. This pioneering Mexican approach appears to be highly
successful. An evaluation prepared for an October economics conference
in Chile shows that after only a couple of years, Progresa significantly
raised the schooling of children in very poor Mexican families. It has
also narrowed the education gap between girls and boys and reduced the
labor force participation of boys.

        Of course, governments need to find the tax revenue to finance
programs
like Progresa. A good start would be to recognize that Mexico and many
other less developed nations typically spend disproportionately on
universities and other education of their elites. Redistributing some of
this spending to the poor would both reduce inequality and stimulate
faster economic growth. Widespread basic education is more effective in
promoting economic development than generous subsidies to the richer
students who attend universities.

        Child-labor critics could spend their time more fruitfully by
attacking
not the overseas employment policies of multinationals but the social
policies of governments in poor nations that are really responsible for
the prevalence of child labor there. These governments, and perhaps
international organizations such as the World Bank, should follow
Mexico's example and introduce programs that pay poor mothers to keep
their teenage and younger sons and daughters in school and out of the
labor force.

Vince:

As I am sure you are aware, we are facing significant challenges with the 
Dabhol project.  As I have delved into the project and our problems, I have 
been disturbed by our lack of information/data relative to our position in 
the grid and the overall fundamentals for the region.  I would like to meet 
with you and get your assistance in identifying some resources to try and 
help the India team develop a better understanding of their market and how to 
identify/develop/use the fundamentals.

Thanks.

Jim

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165."
3,"Lynn,

I spoke with Laura Luce on Friday, and she asked me to coordinate with you to 
arrange a visit to the Chicago office.  We tentatively discussed scheduling 
my visit for Friday January 26 to Monday Jan 29.  Please let me know if these 
dates are still convenient and who I need to contact to make all the 
necessary arrangements.

Thank you for your help,

2,"I've added the third leg to deal 566375 and changed comments in each leg to 
reflect that. We had a bit of confusion about who was actually adding the new 
pub code, but it's in the system now and the deal is ready to be confirmed. 
Just a note - I previously had all the Sunday and Holiday hours in the 
off-peak leg of this deal (so Risk could calc the value correctly), and now 
I've deleted those strips to account for leg 3 which contains only Sunday and 
Holiday hours. Please let me know if anything looks different, other than 
that, on your end.

Thanks,

Here's the latest I have, but there may be another turn in the works.  I've 
asked Pete to send it to you, along with the GE.  I need to do an override

Peter--I'm attempting to get you a revised Exhibit A.  I'll confirm with Kay 
whether we need Jody Pierce as designated recipient of invoices, or whether 
we can have them sent to NEPCo so long as they go to Jody for payment.  There 
is no comma before the LLC after E-Next Generation. Is there any other info 
you need on the ABB breakout? We want to be able to execute it as soon as we 
get you this info.  Thanks.

These changes have been made.  To complete this agreement, we need (a) a
revised Exhibit A, (b)the response to the Don Hamond's question re.
Section 6.7.2 and (c) confirmation of whether it is ""E-Next Generation,
L.L.C."" or ""E-Next Generation LLC"".

Attached is an edited file for the ABB/Fountain Valley agreement. I have
removed and made revisions to several sections to make it specific to
the 3
units for Fountain Valley. Specific revisions include:

Exhibit B1
- Page 23, revise quantity from 6 to 3
- Pages 43 through 86, delete pages specific to other designs

As noted in the forwarded e-mail, the contact information in Sections
25.1
and 25.3 needs to be revised to replace Purchaser -

intended
location for invoices?

(See attached file: ABB Facility Agreement-edits.doc)

2,"John:

Here are two alternatives to the language in AB1X.

The language does two things:

1) ensures that DA customers' costs are shifted to utility customers.
2) ensures that DA customers' don't unfairly escape any costs (e.g., bond 
payments, etc.)

We're assuming that you'll shop these with Lenny and we'll work the Reps on 
SB 18?

Lemme know.

Best,
Jeff

1,"Just a reminder that when entering a wheel, the Interchange ID must be the 
same for the import and export.  When the Import is labeled as ""EPMI_CISO_**"" 
and the Export as ""CISO_EPMI_**,"" the ISO views these as unique imports and 
exports.  They will not be linked together for a wheel, thus causing 
ancillary services charges to occur.  

Thank you!"

Subject:	HIB Visa Application - Sevil Yaman

Sevil:  In order that we may proceed with your request for Permanent Residency, our immigration attorneys have advised us that we need to process the HIB visa, prior to the Permanent Residency application.

Therefore, I am attaching an HIB visa questionnaire that I would like you to complete and return to me, together with copies of all of the documents listed at the bottom of the form.

Please bring these to me in 3AC2026A.

Please let me know if you have any questions at x55083.

Thank you
