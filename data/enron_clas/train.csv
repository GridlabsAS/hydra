We would like to hire Willis Phillips from Koch.   Rogers, Dana, & I have all interviewed him and think he is a can't miss candidate.   The bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter (the fee is 20% of first year package).

This guy is quality and I want to make an offer.   Please let me know if I can proceed ASAP.

_______________________________________________________________

Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up:
                                         1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and
15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections is
to significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event that
governmental action related to the agreement is modified in a manner
unacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can come
at any time during the term of the agreement, and need not  involve
approval  ""required"" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did not
propose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement which
refers to adverse ""rate approval"". However, Peoples' intent may be to
obtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decision
re the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of a
termination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarily
required for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified ""in any manner
which is unacceptable"" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with the
original language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right to
circumstances when a ""required"" approval is revoked.) While the broadened
termination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, I
wouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of a
modified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agency
arrangement.
2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenue
definition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market Hub
Serivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, the
proposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the term
of the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to market
extended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination of
the Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C)
eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue.
Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the last
sentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative net
revenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3,
apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH's
perspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actually
refunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not require
a retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreement
terminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would be
needed.
3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it make
nominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt or
delivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at a
secondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. did
agree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not know
the value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint.
                         4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC be
defined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion.
Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC may
elect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peoples
can, at most, ""propose"" changes in its sole discretion. How about: ""the
effective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may be
modified from time to time."" Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to propose
changes to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here.
                              5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate that
Parking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review this
further.                      6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified the
language giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC to
assign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply with
requirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not be
certificated as a ""natural gas company"", if there is another entity with
clear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act and
FERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicating
that Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensure
compliance with regulatory requirements.
          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of the
sending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change in
information re firm capacity. Perhaps ""in its sole discretion"" can be
delted and the last word of the third sentence changed to ""appropriate"".
                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list of
grounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies the
grounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should not
add to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce provided
under the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illiniois
tariffs have equal scheduling priority.
                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places the
risk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. This
is how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,
however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,
MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. With
the changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment risk
also may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should follow
responsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-payment
risk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or
(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based on
a credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).
     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to the
administrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refunds
for ten business days. Should there be an interest component?
                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. This
Section suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'm
don't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.
Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimize
imbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 are
expected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoples
should attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them on
Wed.
                    13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties to
indicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with ""material"" contractcs and
Judgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect. Is it
suffucuent to have minor contract violations and inconsistency with some
Laws/Judgments?               14. Sect. 7.1 The NIGAS Hub Agreement did not
have a flat fee component.
15. Sect. 10.1. Because the Governmental Approval must be acceptable to
both Peoples and MEH, People should not have ""sole"" authority to prepare
and file all applications.
                                         16. Sect. 10.2. See comments above
re Governmental Approval. Also, I don't think there is a need for the word
""expressly"" in the first sentence.            17. Sect. 11.1. Should the
Section require consent for transfer by operation of law if we wish to have
this requirement in the event that the Hub facilities are sold?

          18. Sect. 15.1 (a). If this type of provision is going to be
included, should there at least be an initial period (say a year) to get
started which doesn't trigger a termination right? The NIGAS Agreement had
a section along these lines.
          19. Sect. 15.1 (f). See comments above re Governmental Approval.
                                                   20. Former 15.1 (f) now
deleted. This provided that the Agency Agreement could be terminated is MEH
is dissolved. This seems necessary to me.          21. 15.1 (g) Peoples
wishes to have sole discretion to change its Facilities or the GTC, but
proposes to limit MEH's termination right in the event that such a change
impairs the HUB's marketability. It seems reasonably to allow MEH to
terminate if it believes that HUB marketability is impaired, without a need
to demonstrate reasonableness.
                                         22. Sect. 17.1 I don't understand
why Peoples wishes to require confidentiality for the compensation
sections. The Illinois Commission Staff and interested parties would have
access to this information under a protective agreement. This would
unnecessarily complicate the approval process and I don't know what there
is to gain from secrecy. These provisions were part of the public record in
the NIGAS approval case.                                     That's all.
Let's discuss tomorrow.

 Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into 
our
gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited 
number 
of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity 
somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: 
For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering 
and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, 
Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" 
affected 
are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 
3218, 
3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and 
3213
for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there 
does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression 
agreements
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
existing
compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications 
it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion 
recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time 
frames.
We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the 
application 
process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once 
granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity
will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for
incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will 
award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the 
incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be 
included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
                                Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after
June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. 
Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close after
Noon on June 12, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of 
your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

oldest, just had her 14th birthday last week!!  They grow so quickly and are 
so precious.  Take care,

Thanks for the info and I will check with Stacy.  I am planning to return 
sometime around January 8th assuming I can find someone.  I have thoroughly 
enjoyed my time at home and hope that the transition back to work goes 
smoothily.  I'm sure it will take me a few weeks to get back into it after 
being away from it for 6 months.  Charles is doing great as is Arthur.  Look 
forward to seeing you soon.  Would $25 be okay with you for Suzanne's gift?

Hi Carol:

Good to hear from you again.  It is 4th quarter-as-usual around here.  Sorry 
I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in 
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me 
know how much I should contribute.  As for your nanny question, I can't help 
you there.   Have you asked Stacy Dickson if she is using an agency, or 
whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the market 
for this.  Hope they can help you out - good luck!  I am sure it is not going 
to be easy to come back.  Have you set a date for your return yet?

Mary

I am beginning the process of looking for a nanny and was wondering if you 
may know of someone or know of an agency that you trust.  We are looking for 
someone to commute to our house each day.  If you do know of someone, please 
let me know.  Also,  on Suzanne's gift, looks like so far it's me and Sheila  
contributing.  Are you interested?

2,"Joe, Jeff an Bob:
Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections 
to our new form of Annex A:

1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply

2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff 
language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if 
they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity.

3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the ""or otherwise"" language in 
the setoff language.  Again, this is a credit issue.

4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting 
a master in place with them.  Sara expects this to happen in the next few 
days.

5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill.  I am working on this 
one and their attorney owes me a response.  This one may take a few weeks.

6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening 
letter.  It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial 
derivatives with them recently.

7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to 
tell me specifically what they object to.  I will continue to follow up with 
their attorney.

8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric.

9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying 
they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.  I will 
follow up with their attorney.

10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z) 
to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation 
as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.  Credit 
should be alerted.

11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A 
and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response.

12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy.

13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an 
ISDA with them.  If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have 
requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA 
negotiations.  I can prepare a mark-up.

Testimony before Senate Energy, Utilities & Communications Committee And the

By Terry M. Winter, President and CEO
California Independent System Operator
August 10, 2000




An August 10th article from Natural Gas Intelligence that talks of the 
defensive posture the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) has 
taken concerning the accusations that Governor Davis' emergency electricity 
report had made about the new deregulated market. 



An article from Natural Gas Intelligence talks about the vote, on July 31st,  
by the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) Board to move the 
price cap to $250. The pros and cons of the price cap are mentioned, as well 
as other remedies for the power situation. Also, there are several comments 
in the article from California Senator Steve Peace on how ""dysfunctional"" the 
market is and why it should be restructured.

I share some of your concerns regarding Mr. Sud. He is retired and he chose
to contact us rather indirectly (or on the spur of the moment).
I understand  that things are done differently in different cultures but I 
did not meet him and could not
form my judgment based on personal observations.

However, the information  he gave us seems to be too important not to convey
to you and not to act upon.

Sorry, I didn't see these deals when I sent the first email.  Kimberly Hundl 
had sent you a note about the contact.  Are these deals like the other two 
deals, and should be confirmed totally separately from the deal #347356.  
Sorry to be so difficult, but we get into trouble everytime we confirm a 
Conoco deal because of the special language that needs to be included on 
deals that are part of #347356, and we never get any notes that tell us 
whether or not it is part of the extension of the original deal.

Thanks!

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Dear Sara:

I apologize for the delay but I have been unsuccessful in finding a good way
to get you your wine.  I am unable to ship FedEx or UPS unless it is going
to a distributor.  We have some customers who live in similar ""unfriendly""
wine states who make arrangements with private mailing companies here in
California and we have mailed it to them.  Unfortunately, the danger in us
doing it is it could get held up somewhere along the way and they may
destroy it.  I believe it is too much wine to risk the possibility.

I will continue to look into other possibilities but if you have any
suggestions or are planning to be in another state soon, please let me know
and I will do whatever I can to get it to you.

Regards,


Jill Melendy
Dutton-Goldfield Winery

Subject: Updated EOL Customer profiles

Frank:

We have recently rethought our treatment of some of our Western 
counterparties.  Originally, if a Western CP traded power in the West under 
the WSPP Agreement, we permitted the CP to enter into Enron Sales only for 
Eastern power pursuant to the on-line GTCs.  However, we have decided that 
certain of such CPs should not be permitted to trade Eastern power at all.  
Accordingly, please revise the profile for the CPs listed below so that they 
cannot buy or sell Eastern power products via EOL:

Arizona Public Service Company
Avista Corporation - Washington Water Power Division
British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation
California Department of Water Resources
City of Redding
Colorado Springs Utilities
Idaho Power Company
Los Angeles Department of Water & Power
Nevada Power Company
Northern California Power Agency
Pacificorp
Public Service Company of Colorado
Public Service Company of New Mexico
Sacremento Municipal Utility District
Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District
San Diego Gas & Electric Company
Seattle City Light
Sierra Pacific Power Company
St. Joseph Light & Power Co.
Tucson Electric Power Company

If any of these CPs have previously traded any Eastern power products, please 
let me know at your earliest convenience so that I can address this issue.

Please note that this change should not affect the ability of these CPs to 
trade Western power products.

Thanks:

In 1999, we treated the increase in expense for Y2K as recurring, but 
reflected the deferral as non-recurring.  It probably would have been more 
appropriate to treat both the increase and deferral as non-recurring.  We 
will change the historical file to reflect that methodology.  This will 
decrease the 1999 recurring Direct O&M by $3.5MM on NNG and $.4MM on TW.  The 
attached file reflects the changes.  This does not have any effect on total 
O&M or IBIT, only the split between recurring and non-recurring.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Oil, Ethanol Industries Far From Deal
On Pending Senate Bill to Limit MTBE


Oil and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of 
the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), making it uncertain 
whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to 
craft an acceptable national
solution to the problem of MTBE in water, lobbyists told BNA April 17-19.

Despite fundamental differences, however, all sources interviewed for this 
story--including two oil industry officials, three ethanol advocates, and 
several other sources active in the legislative process on this issue--said 
that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying 
multiple interests could be developed.

""I don't think we're at an impasse,"" one oil industry official said, echoing 
comments by others in the debate. ""I just think it's going to take time."" 
Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this 
legislative session remains to be seen, this official and others said.

The committee chairman, Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), has made MTBE a priority, 
saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed 
by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality 
benefits associated with MTBE-mixed gasoline.

The chairman's view of the issue, however, is contrary to the view held by 
the Clinton administration, by ranking minority member Sen. Max Baucus 
(D-Mont.), and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the 
Senate. These forces hold that corn-derived ethanol and possibly other 
""renewable"" fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing 
the threat of MTBE water contamination.

The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view.

Smith Rejects 'Renewables' Linkage

When the Clinton administration announced on March 20 its support for a 
national renewable fuels mandate, Smith said ""the issue of renewable fuels 
has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water."" 
He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April 10.

In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates, several other interest groups 
maintain an active role in the ongoing debate, and Senate committee staff ar 
continuing behind-the-scenes meetings with all sides, sources said.

Generally, comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the 
additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely. A committee bill also 
is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act 
mandate currently driving the use of
MTBE and ethanol, another fuel oxygenate. At the same time, such a bill is 
expected to include ""no backsliding"" language to ensure that air toxics 
reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years 
are maintained even if states
waive out of the air act mandate.

Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief 
for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs.

Heavy Reliance on MTBE

MTBE is a high-oxygen, high-octane gasoline additive that is one of the most 
heavily produced chemicals in the United States. With roughly 12 million 
gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States, the 
chemical makes up more than 3 percent of gasoline by volume, according to the 
oil industry.

MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all 
""reformulated gasoline"" contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight. 
Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality. 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 80 percent of 
reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen 
requirement.

However, MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public 
water supplies, rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable. The 
health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known, but the chemical 
does taste and smell bad, according to a February report by the Congressional 
Research Service.

RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in 
their reformulated gasoline. Among other concerns in the legislative debate, 
the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the 2 
percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns, one 
industry representative said.

There were 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in 1999, 
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. USDA chief economist Keith 
Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April 11 that there are 
55 ethanol plants in operation in
""nearly 20 states.""

Bill Would Ease 2 Percent Oxygen Rule

To address water quality concerns, Smith has signed on to legislation (S. 
1886) that would allow states to lift the 2 percent mandate driving MTBE use.

Introduced by Inhofe and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), S. 1886 would not 
ban or phase down MTBE outright. However, this is expected to change when and 
if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive 
legislation, oil, ethanol, and other sources said.

""I think there's a growing set of opinion ... that MTBE either needs to be 
phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some 
years,"" an oil industry source said.

Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul 
of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination.

According to one source familiar with the issue, Senate committee staff 
members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns 
of MTBE interests. Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup 
costs is under consideration, as is the idea that MTBE makers should get 
expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical 
products.

In addition, the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of 
underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation, this 
source said.

Daschle, Harkin Drafts

At least 14 bills have been introduced in the 106th Congress to address the 
problem of MTBE in water, according to the Congressional Research Service 
report. The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act 
requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE.

Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agency's 
underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main 
cause of water contamination. This approach is supported by certain MTBE 
makers, who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and 
not by the high-quality fuel additive.

Additional draft bills are pending introduction, including comprehensive 
legislation by Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the Senate minority leader, that 
would significantly curtail MTBE use by 2004 while letting states take action 
before then.

Daschle's bill--said by Baucus's staff to be supported by the ranking EPW 
committee member--also would bolster ethanol production through a national 
renewable fuels mandate, expanding national average ethanol use to 2 percent 
or more over the next 10 years.

In addition, the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act 
to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs.

Ethanol supporter Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) also is drafting MTBE legislation 
that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senate's Easter recess, a 
spokeswoman said. Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard. ""If crafted in the right 
way,'' Harkin has said, such a standard ""could result in far more ethanol use 
than current law.""

Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity, 
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nebraska ranks third and 
Minnesota ranks fourth.

RFG Market

Despite calls for eliminating the 2 percent oxygenate requirement in the 
reformulated gasoline program, ethanol interests said they still support 
maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban.

Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void, doubling 
ethanol use over three to five years, sources said. If Congress were to 
eliminate the 2 percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels 
requirement, ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current 
levels. However, it would do so over a longer period of about 10 years, one 
ethanol source said.

Oil industry officials, as well as Northeast states and some environmental 
advocates, oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a ""de facto 
ethanol mandate."" The oil industry also continues to oppose a national 
renewable fuels standard, officials said.

A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April 11 that Smith 
appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests, considering a 
national average ""alternative fuel"" requirement that would benefit ethanol as 
well as natural gas, electricity, and other transportation fuels.

The Northeast representative, Jason Grumet of Northeast States for 
Coordinated Air Use Management, supports the national average, alternative 
fuel approach, since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without 
requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwest-derived ethanol.

However, oil company interests reaffirmed April 17 their long-held opposition 
to any new fuel mandates, saying concerns over MTBE in water should be 
addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting 
any new mandates.

Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural 
states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections, a 
second oil industry official said. It is not simply that the industry opposes 
new mandates--though that is
the case--but also that an ethanol-mandate ""bidding war"" might erupt in a 
year when  Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes, the 
official said.

Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion

Meanwhile, ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion 
of their product in the RFG market, and do not necessarily see a national 
renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise.

The Clinton administration's renewable standard would require ethanol use 
initially at current levels of about 1.2 percent of gasoline. The mandate 
would then expand over 10 years, administration officials have said.

Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE, making it more difficult for oil refiners 
to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for 
volatile organic compounds. This is one reason the ""de facto mandate"" is 
opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests. Some of the 
renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to 
meet requirements over an annual average, enabling them to avoid or reduce 
their ethanol use in summer.

Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil, ethanol, environmental, 
MTBE, and state interests continue. A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE 
legislation ""is something we're trying to get done quickly,"" but that a bill 
markup has not been scheduled.

Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE 
legislation are important to the legislative process, sources said, because a 
bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from 
Democrats and Republicans on the committee, as well as from members of the 
Senate Agricultural Committee.

""I just can't see this getting duked out on the floor,"" said one ethanol 
lobbyist. ""I think that we, the MTBE folks, the oil company folks, and the 
environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on 
the floor.""

According to one source, a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE 
use down to pre-1990 levels over about four years. Before the 1990 air act 
amendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline, MTBE was used mainly 
to enhance octane.

It is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both 
Democrats and Republicans, ethanol and oil interests, as well as to Northeast 
states, the Midwest, and California.

""Things change day to day,"" an oil industry official said. ""I think the issue 
could be resolved without the ethanol piece, but the ethanol piece is just so 
difficult,"" he added.

""I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere 
with solid footing,"" an ethanol industry source said."

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >>

Jeff,

I am attaching a list of EOL transactions that we need your help ""cleaning 
up"".  With the new Broker-Client application that EOL is bringing on this 
weekend, we need to remove EOL from the broker field.  What we have run into 
is:  there are many deals in Tagg that have EOL in the broker field but no 
EOL number.  We are requesting that risk go through and add the EOL deal 
number to the tagg legs where there is none listed.  The reason for this is 
that if we remove EOL from the broker field and there is no EOL deal number 
reference, then there is no way to no if that deal is an EOL deal.  For audit 
purposes, no one could tie back to the deals.  

Please give this list to the appropriate risk groups (by index).  Let me know 
if you have any further questions.  ALSO, this list is in addition to the 
list that I provided Errol yesterday.

Thank you,
Dawn

0,"In the final analysis, we did not make a lot of progress in reaching 
agreement to settle the RP99-507 proceeding on El Paso's capacity allocation 
proposal at the conference in San Francisco last week.

The parties have agreed to proceed on a dual track because of Burlington's 
concerns about timing.  We will  reconvene for settlement discussions July 12 
and 13 at Southwest Gas's offices in Las Vegas after comments and reply 
comments are filed as permitted under the procedures agreed to at the May 2 
technical conference at FERC.  Comments are due June 30 and reply comments on 
July 7.  Amoco and Burlington filed the original complaint on September 21, 
1999, and requested fast-track processing under the Commission's new 
complaint procedures.  Burlington is pushing to have the Commission adhere to 
the fast-track processing of the complaint, maintaining that an order should 
have been issued within 240 days (I don't know where they got that from -- I 
can't find any such requirement), and vehemently opposed any attempts to 
extend the procedural schedule.

The tone of the meeting was set when Harvey Morris, representing the CPUC, 
was allowed to make a statement because he had to leave by 1:30 (the meeting 
started about 12:30).  He started by saying that the CPUC was in complete 
opposition to the Settlement Proposal circulated by El Paso on June 6, and 
then outlined all the reasons it was unfair to California shippers and was in 
violation of the '96 Settlement.  

After Harvey spoke, El Paso then reviewed its June 6 settlement proposal, 
which you received by e-mail, and provided some additional explanations of 
assumptions, etc.  Then the parties met in individual groups to caucus on 
their positions and reconvened as a group to discuss. 

Of particular note was the allocation of the 360 MM/d of San Juan-only 
capacity that El Paso proposed to take back from Burlington (97J4) and Amoco 
(97JB).  El Paso said that it had been allocated 106 MM to the Havasu 
shippers, 180 MM to the EOC shippers, and 74 MM to all others (California CD 
shippers).  This was a major point of contention in most of the ensuing 
discussions -- California shippers objected to EOC getting the lion's share 
of the additional San Juan capacity.  Under El Paso's proposal, EOC shippers 
would get 82% of their rights from San Juan and 18% from Permian, based on 
BDs.  CD shippers, on the other hand, get 61% and 39%, respectively.

EOC shippers pointed out that the BDs were not actually representative of 
their load.  BDs were simply a number negotiated among the EOC shippers to 
allocate the costs that were allocated between EOC and California in the '96 
settlement.  Certain EOC shippers suggested that their specified rights 
should be based on some other calculation, such as non-coincident peak day 
usage, rather than BD.

Another major issue was the proposal that full requirements shippers (FR 
shippers) be given systemwide receipt point rights in addition to the 
specified rights they would get based on their billing determinants (BD).  El 
Paso proposed that these systemwide rights would have a scheduling priority 
superior to that of a CD shipper using its capacity on an alternate firm 
basis (either alternate receipt/primary delivery or alternate 
receipt/alternate delivery).  Of course, the FR shippers approved of the 
proposal but most other parties  objected to it.  Several suggestions were 
advanced to try to reach a compromise (for instance, limiting FR shippers to 
primary specified receipt point rights during Cycle 1 nominations), but none 
were accepted.  Most non-FR shippers stated concerns about the practical 
impact of giving FR shippers such a scheduling priority, particularly since 
El Paso's interpretation was that the FR shippers would not have to nominate 
any of their Permian specified rights in order to come back to the San Juan 
with  the systemwide rights.

Everyone pretty much agreed that El Paso's proposal for capacity release of 
receipt point rights (#4 in their write-up) was a non-starter.  It was put on 
the table to address an earlier suggestion by EOC shippers that, if they 
could be made economically neutral to using non-San Juan points, they might 
be more receptive to some restrictions on their specified rights.  What they 
were looking for was some discount for using Permian and there was some 
further discussion along those lines but El Paso was not receptive, stating 
that such would mean opening the allocation of costs in the rate case.

A third issue was who gets what rights at SoCal/Topock.  SoCal Gas doesn't 
consider El Paso's proposal not to sell Block II turned-back capacity to its 
Topock point to be of much value since FERC has said they can't anyway.  
SoCal Gas is looking for a right to get out of any of its contract for which 
it cannot get a specified delivery point of SoCal/Topock.  However, SoCal Gas 
can't at this point commit to the group a number that it could live with as a 
specified right at Topock.  Conversely, all the other CD shippers who think 
they bought firm rights at SoCal/Topock are not willing to see SoCal Gas get 
all the rights unless they, too, can get out of their contracts.

Fuel was the other contentious issue that seems to be a key sticking point 
for certain parties -- some insist it has to remain in the settlement, others 
say there can't be a settlement if it stays in.  El Paso's proposal would 
move the fuel rate back to 4.85% effective 2/1/00 by changing the way they 
eliminate fuel used in facilities that have been refunctionalized as 
gathering.  In the filing to be effective 2/1/01, the rate would go down to 
approximately 4.4% and then to 3.88% on 1/1/03.  Burlington insists they will 
opt out of the settlement if they don't get relief on fuel.  Apparently, to 
the extent El Paso doesn't include the costs of compressors that Burlington's 
gas utilizes in systemwide fuel, they have to pay a higher fuel rate to El 
Paso's gathering affiliate.  They say it has already cost them several 
million dollars (I heard numbers between $9 and $27 million -- no hard data), 
and they will not settle without getting something in return.  

After the full group discussion and statements of position on Monday 
afternoon, Rick Miles, the FERC ADR facilitator, pushed for individual 
meetings between the various segments (EOC, California, producers, marketers, 
El Paso), based on several parties' representations that they were willing to 
continue talking.  A schedule was worked out and the individual meetings took 
up the morning on Tuesday.  Just before lunch, the entire group got back 
together and accepted Mr. Miles' suggestion that each segment select three or 
four representatives who would then engage in a full discussion of the 
issues.  He felt that with a smaller group it might be easier to reach some 
understandings.  However, it apparently didn't work because he called us all 
back late in the afternoon for a full group discussion, where the positions 
outlined above were stated and restated.  Certain parties, when pressed, 
could not agree to certain basic principles because, they said, they would 
have to get input from others in their organization.  Mr. Miles expressed his 
frustration that parties were at the table who didn't know what their bottom 
line position was (e.g., SoCal Gas, Southwest Gas).  Following discussion by 
the producers, particularly Burlington, as noted above that they would not 
agree to an extension of the date for filing comments, the next settlement 
meeting was scheduled after the filing dates.  Mr. Miles requested that 
parties send him an e-mail note that would state their bottom line settlement 
position, which he would keep confidential.  He would review all the 
positions and to the extent possible put then together and float a settlement 
package of his own.  He assured all that no one would be able to identify the 
individual positions from his package.

One positive note at this meeting was that there was no conflict over the 
pooling committee's report.  No one registered any complaints, although a few 
parties who had not been at the last settlement conference indicated that 
they would like to participate.

 This is how I see our bottom-line position.  I would like to send it to Rick 
late this week if everyone agrees.

A pooling procedure that will follow assigned priority rankings for both 
market and supply with no restrictions on pool-to-pool transfers (loops 
allowed).
Only San Juan receipt point rights on our Havasu contract, or, preferably, 
termination of the contract so that the San Juan rights could be allocated to 
others as part of a settlement.
Full requirements shippers systemwide rights above their specified point 
rights would not have a higher priority than CD shippers using alternate 
delivery points, although no objection to using some allocation method other 
than billing determinants, such as peak day volume, to establish those 
specified point rights. 

Do you have any opinion about the allocation of SoCal/Topock rights?  Please 
give me a call when you've had a chance to look this over.  I'm sure you'll 
have some questions!  Also, we'll need to talk about what kind of comments we 
want to file."

Subject: Re: VEPCO PPA  

Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:
I haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times 
there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency 
power to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would 
want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to 
replace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get 
this agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).  
I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.
Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting 
transmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its 
network transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have 
to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the 
plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to 
supply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin 
Presto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's 
network transmission to delivery to third parties.
Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent 
rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While 
VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that 
you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to 
transmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only 
way to ensure deliverability to third parties.
3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an 
increase.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other 
sources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission 
and subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on 
best/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase 
daily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of 
receipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as 
non-firm.)
12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that 
has not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since 
FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant 
changes in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining 
transmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this 
contract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price 
covers that circumstance.
Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at 
most any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any 
current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will 
pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this 
contract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.

Subject: VEPCO PPA

Christi--

This is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively 
early draft of the PPA.

I think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and 
do the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.  
IN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up 
the regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue 
less contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at 
Rockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.  

Using the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their 
gas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas 
from the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the 
NCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think 
that we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply 
working on some of the siting issues.

That being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or 
Jeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there 
are some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.  

Thanks.

		 Subject: VEPCO PPA


Lisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based 
on the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did 
encounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are 
noted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and 
are also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this 
goes to VEPCO.

Cover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be 
ENA or a special purpose company?

Definitions--  We included a defined term ""Emergency Start-Up"" (a start up or 
increase in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to 
include a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.

Section 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy 
charge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?

Section 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD 
will be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, 
it would be best to define ""commencement of construction"" to avoid 
controversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a 
placeholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is 
your preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific 
remedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that 
milestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would 
be a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 
days if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the 
cure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?

Section 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under 
this PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement 
to sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the 
Facility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take 
1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be 
pro-rated for the first year?

Section 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of 
Availability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the 
total hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated 
that the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other 
than due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled 
maintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be 
available.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated 
that a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why 
wouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we 
included language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during 
peak periods.

Section 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of 
Energy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we 
allow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?

Section 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.

Section 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?

Article 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not 
have any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do 
you want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for 
now?

Section 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or 
would you prefer a shorter period?

Article 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step 
prior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is 
""baseball"" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's 
position or the other's.  Is that what you want?

Section 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it 
will be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not 
recommend Virginia law for this contract.

Exhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please 
see the bracketed notes therein.

Please call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.

1,"Operations is digging out 2000 feet of pipe to begin the hydro test today or 
thursday.  If the test results are good, they'll recoat the pipe and put it 
back in service.  We could be at 80% volume on Friday afternoon, but this is 
tentative.  

Also, the smart pig test run several months ago identified 4 potential areas 
that need inspections west of station 5.  While east of thoreau is down, 
these 4 areas will also be inspected.

Do not pass this info onto customers at this point till we have further 
information.  We will make a posting hopefully this afternoon.  Operations is 
also trying to combine some additional compressor work to this outage (i.e. 
grouting another unit and replacing some valves).  This work will limit our 
west deliveries to 875,000.  This notice will also be posted shortly.

see me if you have questions

Hey Chris,

Sorry about the phone call -- kinda difficult being discreet around here --
you know!

Yes! I'd definitely like to meet anytime this week.  Lunchtime might be
kinda rough for

you and me both, eh?  So,....maybe dinner one or more nights this week??
I'm available

any evening this week.  Just let me know!


I also spoke with Marde @ EES.  She says that ""Tom Hermanic"" from her group
will

be calling me soon as well.  It appears that they could use a good
Northeast/CNG

scheduler in the Commodity Risk Management group ASAP.  I applied for the
position via

Marde and the Job# as is posted on the Enron company job site (online).
Just reading

over the qualifications and pre-reqs,.....I like the position and feel that
I could contribute

immediately.

 Let's keep in touch, Chris!  Thanks for calling me!

   Sincerely,......Alain

afforded me by chairing RMS.  This position took a lot of work,

Delaney, attached fyi is the testimony PG&E submitted to the CPUC last week
on financial issues associated with our TRA undercollection and TURN's
petition for modification.  Also attached is a copy of yesterday's ruling of
the administrative law judge rejecting this testimony for consideration as
part of the evidentiary record of this phase of the proceeding. Needless to
say, we believe our testimony is informative and helpful and should be
considered as part of the overall policy debate on this vital issue.

Please feel free to pass this testimony along to others who might be
interested, and feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

MISSOURI
Lawmakers seek to oust three PSC members

Rep. Dennis Bonner (D., District 51) and Sen. Ronnie DePasco (D.,
District 11) are trying to oust three members of the Public Service
Commission who refused to hold a public hearing before the PSC approved
a Missouri Gas Energy application to raise its rates by 44%.  Bonner
filed a resolution in the House yesterday afternoon seeking the removal
of the commissioners, and DePasco plans to file an identical resolution
in the Senate today, Bonner told TR.

The 44% rate hike was ""ridiculous,"" Bonner told TR.  ""People in my
district can't afford to pay that.""  Bonner said, however, that he
""would have been happy if [the commissioners] would have held a
hearing.""  Bonner said he and DePasco had warned the PSC in advance that
they would try to expel any commissioners who approved the rate hike
request without holding a public hearing first.

The three commissioners who voted in favor of the rate increase were
Chairwoman Sheila Lumpe and Commissioners Connie Murray and M. Dianne
Drainer.  Bonner and DePasco aren't trying to remove commissioners
Kelvin Simmons and Robert Schemenauer, who voted against the rate
increase.

FUTURE OF REGULATION
LOUISIANA
PSC elects new leadership

The Public Service Commission has elected Commissioner James M. Field
(R., District 2) as its new chairman, a commission staff member told
TR.  Commissioner Jack A. (Jay) Blossman Jr. (R., District 1) was
elected vice chairman.

Field joined the PSC Dec. 2, 1996, and his term ends Dec. 31, 2006.
Blossman became a commission member Jan. 1, 1997, and his term expires
Dec. 31, 2002.

MONTANA
House unanimously approves Uniform Electronic Transactions Act

The House has approved overwhelmingly a Uniform Electronic Transaction
Act to prohibit anyone from denying legal effect or enforceability to a
record or signature solely because it's in electronic form.  (1/19/01
a.m.)  Secretary of State Mike Cooney (D.) requested HB 234, which was
sponsored officially by Rep. Bob Lawson (R., District 80).

Each government agency would be able to determine whether and to what
extent it would send and accept electronic records and electronic
signatures.  Government agencies, however, wouldn't be limited to any
specific types of technologies.

HB 234 also states that electronic signatures would be valid only if all
parties agreed to conduct a transaction electronically.  If a party
agreed to conduct one transaction by electronic means, the party could
refuse to conduct other transactions electronically.  This right to opt
out of electronic transactions couldn't be waived.

HB 234 awaits consideration by the Senate Business and Labor Committee.

ALTERNATIVE REGULATION
MONTANA
Lawmakers to examine price cap regulation

State lawmakers will be considering a bill to allow telecom carriers to
opt out of rate-of-return regulation if they accept price cap
regulation.  LC 655, which awaits introduction, states that a local
exchange carrier's (LEC's) election to accept price cap regulation would
be irrevocable.  Qwest Corp. proposed the bill's language, the
legislative staff told TR.  Sen. Fred Thomas (R., District 31) requested
the measure.

LB 655 would set a LEC's price caps at the permanent rates last
authorized by the Public Service Commission for the company before it
elected to come under the new regulatory structure.  The price floors
would be set at total-service long-run incremental cost.

The new prices set under the price cap regulation would be indefinite;
no specific time reference is included in the draft bill.  The PSC
wouldn't be able to change the price caps unless changes were needed to
reflect a new tax or fee.  The prices also could change to allow a LEC
to recover the additional cost of providing a new telecom service or the
expense of a new or expanded program, such as an extended area service
region.

Additionally, the prices could change if the LEC filed an application
with the PSC and justified a change in a price cap.  The commission
would have 60 days to act on the application.

If a complaint were filed by a consumer or consumer counsel regarding
the company's prices and the PSC found the company had violated the
provisions of this measure, the commission would have the authority to
order the LEC to comply with the measure.  The draft bill is available
at http://data.opi.state.mt.us/bills/2001/lchtml/LC0655.htm.

VIDEO
IOWA
Bill aims to provide equal treatment for cable TV companies

Sen. Mary Lundby (R., District 26) has introduced SF 47 to require a
city granting more than one cable TV franchise to make the terms and
conditions of the additional franchise no more favorable and no less
burdensome than those of the existing franchise agreement.

Terms and conditions would include the territorial extent of the
franchise; system design; technical performance standards; construction
schedule; performance bonds; standards for construction and installation
of cable TV facilities; service to subscribers; public, government, and
educational access channels and programming; liability and
indemnification; and franchise fees.

If the terms or conditions of any additional franchise were more
favorable or less burdensome than the terms or conditions of any
existing cable TV franchise, the more favorable or less burdensome terms
or conditions also would apply for any existing cable TV franchise.

SF 47 has been referred to the Senate Commerce Committee.

ILLINOIS
ICC seeks extension of 10-digit dialing in Chicago area

The state Commerce Commission yesterday asked the FCC to extend a waiver
it granted to the commission to delay implementation of 10-digit dialing
in the Chicago metropolitan area until April 1.

On Jan. 17 North American Numbering Plan administrator (NANPA) NeuStar,
Inc., informed the ICC that the last NXX code in the ""847"" area code had
been assigned and that the first NXX code in the ""224"" ""overlay"" would
be assigned in 30 days.  Activation would occur 90 days thereafter.

Assuming that NANPA is correct, and that there are no NXX codes in the
847 NPA that should be returned, activation of the first code in the 225
NPA may occur on or after May 17, the ICC said..  It said its success
forestalling exhaustion of the five Chicago codes may cause the
temporary waiver to expire before activation of a single new NXX code in
the 224 overlay or any other Chicago area code.  (CC docket 96-98)

WIRELESS
HAWAII
Bill targets drivers' use of handheld wireless phones

Rep. K. Mark Takai (D., District 34) has introduced HB 225 to make it
illegal to drive while talking on a handheld wireless phone.  Persons
convicted of using their wireless phones while driving would face a
maximum $100 fine for a first offense.  Violators could face a maximum
$200 fine for second offenses and a maximum $500 fine for any additional
offenses.

In addition to the fines, anyone caught violating the measure would be
required to attend a traffic safety class and pay a $50 driver
assessment fee.

HB 225 would provide exemptions for any drivers making ""911"" emergency
calls, reporting traffic accidents, or having a reason to fear for their
lives.  The bill awaits consideration by House Transportation Committee
and the House Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs Committee.

CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
OKLAHOMA
Bill calls on OCC to provide EAS for every exchange

Sen. Frank Shurden (D., District 8) has prefiled SB 151 to require the
Corporation Commission to expand the state's current wide area calling
(or extended area service) plans to include every local exchange in the
state.  The OCC would have to implement wide area calling plans that
correspond to the areas served by the ""405,"" ""580,"" and ""918"" number
planning areas.

The bill acknowledges that the OCC can implement the wide area numbering
plans only to the extent possible under federal law.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT
MASSACHUSETTS
Bill would create nonprofit corporation to manage DTE info service

Sen. Linda J. Melconian (D., Hampden) has introduced SB 400 to create a
nonprofit corporation called Mass211, Inc., to administer the
information and referral service established by the Department of
Telecommunications and Energy.

Last year the DTE ordered the abbreviated dialing code ""211"" to be
assigned to the service.  The service will refer callers to agencies
that deal with domestic violence, substance abuse, elder services,
crisis intervention, health care, housing, food and fuel donations,
support groups, family counseling, and a range of other health and human
services.  (5/22/00 a.m.)

The bill has been referred to the Government Regulations Committee.  Its
text is available at http://www.state.ma.us/legis/bills/st00400.htm.

NEW YORK
Bills aim to protect consumer privacy

Legislators are considering three bills to enhance phone customers'
privacy.  Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky (D., District 86) has
introduced AB 1390 to prohibit the ""transmission of unsolicited bulk
electronic mail.""  The bill would establish criminal and civil penalties
to be assessed against violators of the proposed anti-spamming law.  AB
1390 has been referred to the Committee on Consumer Affairs and
Protection; its text is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01390.

Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer (D., District 67) has introduced AB 1668
to require local exchange carriers to provide, free of charge, unlisted
telephone numbers for victims of domestic violence.  The bill has been
referred to the Committee on Corporations.  Its text is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01669.

AB 1589, sponsored by Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr. (D., District 43),
aims to protect users of cordless and mobile phones against
eavesdropping.  The measure would prohibit the ""mechanical overhearing
of a conversation"" when the person ""overhearing the conversation knows
that it emanates"" from a cordless or mobile telephone.  The bill resides
in the Committee on Codes.  Its text is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01589.

MISSOURI
PSC gives ALLTEL more time to comply with billing rules

The Public Service Commission has granted ALLTEL Missouri, Inc.'s
request for an extension until March 31 to comply with two new billing
rules.  The commission's order adopts an agreement reached by ALLTEL,
the commission staff, and the public counsel.

On Sept. 22, 2000, ALLTEL told the PSC it couldn't update fully its
billing program to accommodate the new rules until March 31 and asked
for an exemption until that time.  The billing rules went into effect at
the end of October 2000.

The agreement calls for ALLTEL to continue sending its traditional
notice of discontinuance until the company begins following a new rule
on ""discontinuance of service to residential customers.""  In addition,
the agreement requires ALLTEL to review manually each account for which
service is at risk of being disconnected until the company implements
the new billing rules.  The agreement also asked ALLTEL to continue
sending notices to customers who haven't paid their accounts.  The
notices must inform customers when they must pay to avoid losing
service.

The PSC's order is available at
http://www.psc.state.mo.us/orders/01231204.htm.

just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.  It is  so  
difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that 
still doesn't see value in you.  But, that is my problem not yours.

In regards to your party , your right, I laughed at the invitation - (It is

2,"I think Jeff like myself has been out of the office so I am responding from 
the US tax side. Jeff please correct the following as appropriate.

When the US tax group reviewed the original matrix they identified 
counterparties as being unable to trade US financials where those parties 1) 
were not incorporated in the US, and 2) there was no US withholding tax 
documentation on file. Where on the matrix it was not clear where an entity 
was incorporated it was assumed for this purpose NOT to have been 
incorporated in the US.

Thus if the review establishes that in fact some of these entities are 
incorporated in the US, the prohibition on these entities trading US 
financials can be lifted.

Jeff was in the process of reviewing the matrix.

Subject: Re: Country/State of Incorporation  

For U.S. based counterparties, State of Incorporation is fairly readily 
available from Dun & Bradstreet - if they are in fact incorporated entities.
 We have only recently requested a full extract of this information from D&B 
for our counterparties (because this is also required for SAP).
 Because of difficulties in matching our records to D&B - their names are NOT 
always the exact legal name - we have only been able to obtain
 roughly 7365 out of the more than 11,400 records we have (65%).  Of the 7365 
records matched, not all have State of Incorporation either because 
 1) They are not U.S. parties or 2) They are not incorporated entities or 3) 
D&B is missing the information (990).

 We recently obtained a list of state of incorporation for companies from 
Legal which is the source we were going to use to populate this information 
for the  ones we were missing.  We hired temps to do this, but were then 
requested to stop this activity by Frank Davis.

 For Foreign entities, the country of incorporation has been difficult to 
find as it is not readily available from D&B.  Any knowledge or suggestions 
would be appreciated.

We are changing our procedures to request this information when we call the 
counterparty to collect information for setup.

In reviewing the counterparty matrix of 9/8, we can assist with providing 
some of the state of incorporations for parties in Sections 2,3, and 4.  I 
have asked IT to extract this information from GCP for you.  Country of 
Incorporation for non-U.S. does not yet exist in GCP - this is currently 
under development with a target production date of mid-October therefore, 
this cannot be provided.  I think however, that the London Credit system has 
Country of Registration (same as Incorporation) that could possibly help.

As soon as the values we have for State of Incorporation are populated in the 
counterparty matrix, I will forward to you.

Subject: Country/State of Incorporation

The objective of EnronOnline is to trade with as many people as possible in 
as many product types as possible.  

Both the legal and tax reviews that I have seen thus far have included 
non-trade status customers that I understand may or may not be eligible to 
trade if we had the country/state of incorporation.  Apparently our records 
are not very robust relative to this piece of information.  

If possible I would like to get a better understanding of all the issue 
surrounding country of incorporation so that we can determine the best course 
of action for obtaining this information if we determine that it is 
essential.  In addition to ensure that we collect this information each time 
we add a new counterparty.

Short of having this information it is my understanding that US tax has 
completed its review of the counterparty matrix and 

Questions:

Is anyone aware of an easy way of obtaining country/state of incorporation?

If we had country/state of incorporation how many counterparties would be 
affected?  (That is if we had country/state of incorporation it might allow 
us to take a counterparty from non-trade status to trade status.)

Can we identify the counterparty names (on the customer matrix which was 
e-mailed on 08/09/99 copy attached) which might be affected by having 
country/state of incorporation?

Is this the only remaining issue impacting the tax review of the counterparty 
matrix dated 08/09/99.  If so are Jeff and Janine ready to sign off on the 
matrix? Can I get a copy of your completed matrix for upload?

"
1,"1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project.

Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on 
schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.  
PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of 
separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon 
tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not 
create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, 
according to PG&E, are in place.

PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to 
discuss maintenance issues with ET&S.

Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. 
pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or 
disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E 
will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or 
dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has 
indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce 
costs associated with cleaning the pipe.

2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. 

Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at 
MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round 
of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples 
collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to 
be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels 
north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing 
showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has 
been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be 
collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant 
to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is 
considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.

Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The 
gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas 
Co.  system which is PCB free.

3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. 

West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system 
has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these 
locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to 
have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the 
sampling program.  
Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs 
under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the 
pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the 
bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By 
increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.

It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the 
separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.

4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.

Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter 
separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The 
determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) 
a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of 
the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.
Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) 
have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern 
River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have 
shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this 
location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that 
there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume 
of gas deliveries.

PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional 
filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer 
load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection 
at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express 
additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.

5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.

 a. Siting, Design and Engineering

 b. Cost Estimates 

PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus 
an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next 
week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter 
separators may be proposed for installation.  

The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 
indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have 
not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites 
basis as PG&E presented.

One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions 
of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement 
company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the 
success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the 
cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it 
will be a 2001 project.

6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.

Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic 
sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to 
the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the 
Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies 
to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will 
coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.

7. Other Issues or Concerns.

Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 
2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to 
Transwestern.  

PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 
mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S 
configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.  

8. Next Steps.

The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow 
inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection   
additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location 
of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as 
some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
other business.  "

As a back up plan, Joe asked the institutions to have the insurers look at a wrap without fixing the confidentiality/guarantee and using an Enron to fill any potential holes.  We'll then be able to balance timing vs proceeds vs legal risk.

I think your collective e-mails constitute the legal risk memo.  What do you 
think the legal risk rating ought to be?

		 Subject: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?

Mark, thanks for the voice mail.  In terms of a risk memo, I agree that one 
should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as 
normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master 
Agreement and without an outlay of capital, but hopefully the following 
(together with my memo from last night - copy attached) suffices to the 
extent a risk memo is required.

In terms of unusual risks:

1.  We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master.  
However, the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially 
Government of Alberta credit risk.  Derek Davies is I believe dealing with 
Credit to resolve credit issues.  In fact, I believe the Balancing Pool is 
taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which 
does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds.

2.  The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental 
guarantee of Enron Corp. and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for 
collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron 
Corp.'s creditworthiness.

3.  It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into 
back-to-back physical hedges for 70% of the volume we acquire, and we are 
currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding 
and being successful in the auction.  Penalties can be imposed if 70% of the 
volume purchased is not properly hedged.

4.  As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta, we always run the risk 
(as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired 
in the first auction) that they can change the auction rules, the market 
rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us.  In terms of the 
auction rules, as with the first auction, they could be better drafted, but 
our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post 
a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back, and to ensure that 
the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete 
control of whether or not we can comply with the rules.

Peter.

Subject: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?

Mark, as I have mentioned to you the Plan B Alberta Power Auction is 
scheduled for Nov 29/00, under which Enron Canada can purchase for one-year 
terms, in each of three successive years, up to approximately 300MW/year #1;  
130MW/year #2; and 65MW/year #3, of the unsold PPA capacity that reverted 
back to the Balancing Pool of Alberta following the first auction last 
August.  The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US 
Thanksgiving is Thursday/Friday.  I wanted you to be aware of this, and 
determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained.

Firstly, Derek Davies/John Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent 
authorized by Lavo.

Secondly, bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction, the forms 
of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are 
successful, and requires a bid deposit (approximately C$6.5MM), but does not 
obligate us to bid and, provided we comply with the auction rules, the Bid 
Deposit will be returned after the auction.

Thirdly, unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms 
of volume and term.  In terms of documentation, if we are the successful 
bidder, we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical 
Master, which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which, 
although not entirely to our liking, is generally satisfactory.

Fourthly, the position will, I understand, be managed in the power trading 
book within approved position limits.  Note:  The nominal amounts owing (i.e. 
no up front payment is required) on an unhedged basis for the entire 300MWs 
in year #1 would be something like C$260MM, assuming a C$100/MW purchase 
price.  Year #2 would be C$114MM and year #3 would be C$57MM.

Given the nature of the transaction, the short time that we have with US 
Thanksgiving intervening, and numerous other demands, I do not believe that a 
DASH, Risk Memo and/or Board Approval is necessary, but please let me know.

I will leave you a brief voice mail to follow-up.

Peter.

> and conference call.  On that basis, please find below the following
> advice on the following issues:
> 1. Legal and Privacy Statement.
> We believe that the Legal and Privacy statement should be available on the

> The Legal and Privacy statement contains important legal protections for

> 2. Bid Box

> that the main wording in the bid box be ""I want to buy [quantity]"" or ""I
> want to sell [quantity]"".
> 3. Availability of PA and ETA
> There is little case law to guide us as to the best approach for ensuring
> that agreements formed online are sufficiently executed to be enforced by
> courts in England.  To improve Enron's argument that the ETA has been
> sufficiently executed and agreed to by the counterparty, we advise that
> the ETA be available for viewing and printing at all times through a
> hotlink in the trading section of the website. This will assist our
> argument that the ETA is incorporated by reference when a counterparty
> signs the PA.  If, for some reason, (for example, the ETA is not available
> at the time of signing the PA), the direct incorporation of the ETA
> argument fails, the hotlink to the ETA may help to establish a course of
> dealing argument.  That is an argument that over time the counterparty has
> been trading on the same terms and conditions for each trade and has,
> therefore, affirmed its initial acceptance of those terms and conditions.
> 4. Registration Forms
> We look forward to an opportunity to review the online registration form
> for new customers.  We also look forward to reviewing the online
> registration form for view only users of the website.  Prior to our review
> of the view only registration form, can you please confirm whether or not
> Enron will be vetting view only applications.  If view only users are
> issued passwords automatically, without a confirmation of identity or
> other verification or clearance by Enron, then we should discuss the
> possible risks and legal issues that may arise.
> 5. Master Agreements
> We understand that Enron is internally discussing the relationship between
> Master Agreement, NBP terms and NBP side letters.  The conclusion of these
> discussion may require an amendment to the ETA, in particular clause 3(a).
> 6. Changes to the GTCs and ETA
> It is clear from an English law perspective and the bulk of overseas
> jurisdictions consulted by us that an change to the GTCs or ETA will
> require the counterparty to accept the change by executing a new version
> of the agreement.  Three issues have arisen in implementing this process:
> (a) Marking up Changes:  From a legal as well as a public relations
> perspective it is preferable that amended agreements contain a process for
> indicating what changes have been made.  This process could take the form
> of a list of changes or double underline or other mark-up procedure.
> Changes should be indicated against the previous version. All versions
> should be dated.  Similarly, the ticker tape screen should indicate that
> there is a new version until that new version is accepted.
> That said, this position is advisable only if Enron can be certain that
> all changes to amended agreements are identified.  If amended agreements
> are presented for execution that are improperly marked-up or do not
> mark-up certain changes, then Enron would have a lesser chance of
> enforcing these unmarked changes than if no marking-up was shown.
> Therefore, this process is advisable only if Enron can ensure that all
> changes are identified.
> (b) Notice of changes: We have previously discussed with you what
> procedure should be adopted by Enron to notify counterparties of the
> change in the ETA or GTCs.  To improve any argument that a counterparty
> has freely consented to an amended agreement, we would advise that Enron
> adopt a procedure for notifying counterparties of the altered agreements
> in advance of them taking effect.  This notice should not be a contractual
> obligation, rather an internal Enron procedure.  That said, we understand
> from our meeting that there may be emergency situations requiring an
> immediate change to an agreement, with the result that trading is
> suspended under the old agreement.  If those circumstances are likely to
> be the bulk of cases when amendments are to be made, then the notice
> process may not necessarily be appropriate.  If notice is not given, then
> Enron would be relying on the following elements as asserting that a
> counterparty freely accepted the amended agreement:
> (i) that the counterparty was prompted that the agreement had been amended
> (and if mark-ups are provided, that the changes were indicated); and
> (ii) that the counterparty is a professional organisation with experience
> in the speed and pace of the commodities trading industry.
> These elements are not conclusive but would give Enron an argument that
> the counterparty is bound to any accepted amended agreement.
> (c) Overseas Counsel: Advice from overseas counsel on amendment of the ETA
> and GTCs did not specify that Enron would not be giving the counterparty a
> period of notice of changes to the agreements, during which the
> counterparty could continue to trade.  Therefore, if it is ultimately
> decided that no notice period will be used, then we may need to seek
> further advice from overseas counsel.
> 7. ETA Termination
> Under your recent instructions we have amended the ETA so that it can only
> be terminated for convenience by Enron.  That is, there is no express
> termination for convenience right for a counterparty.  We have previously
> noted that this means that an ETA may continue to be in force with a

> Enron.  Advice from overseas counsel on the drafting of the ETA and GTCs
> was sought based on a reciprocal right to terminate with notice. We will
> seek further advice from overseas counsel on this issue.
> 8. Website Text Review
> We look forward to an opportunity to review the text and layout of the
> website to assess the final impact of the layout and text on the

> 9. Data Protection
> Since our meetings and conference call, we have discussed further our
> recent advice to you on data protection.  We are currently seeking the
> further advice of overseas counsel of this issue and will provide further
> advice to you shortly.
> 10. German digital signatures

   Word of the Day for Saturday March 23, 2002:

   forlorn \fur-LORN; for-\, adjective:
   1. Sad and lonely because deserted, abandoned, or lost.
   2. Bereft; forsaken.
   3. Wretched or pitiful in appearance or condition.
   4. Almost hopeless; desperate.

     Henry  had  felt  guilty  at  abandoning his sister; he had
     married not once but twice, leaving Rose forlorn.
     --Anita Brookner, [1]Visitors

     In  these  forlorn regions of unknowable dreary space, this
     reservoir  of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the
     accumulation  of  centuries  of  winters,  glazed in Alpine
     heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the
     multiplied rigours of extreme cold.
     --Francis  Spufford,  [2]I  May  Be  Some Time: Ice and the
     English Imagination

     Bloch  remembers  that  Stephen  was  a  member of the Milk
     Squad,  comprised  of  children who were considered to need
     extra  nutrition,  and early photographs do show him as one
     of the smaller boys, in the front row, looking forlorn.
     --Meryle Secrest, [3]Stephen Sondheim: A Life
     _________________________________________________________

   Forlorn  comes  from Old English forleosan, ""to abandon,"" from
   for- + leosan, ""to lose.""

0,"DEAR OII AND OFO SETTLEMENT PARTIES:

Thank you to the parties who worked very hard to develop the September 15,
1999 OFO Settlement Proposal in response to PG&E's August 18 proposal.  We
have carefully reviewed your settlement offer and sought clarification where
needed.  As a result, PG&E is able to accept most of the changes and
provisions contained in that proposal, and is offering back a few
modifications which we think should allow us to reach closure on a
multi-party OFO Settlement Agreement.  We encourage all parties to sign this
settlement.

Our September 24, 1999 response is attached in two forms.  One is a summary
of the items we agree with and those where we have changes, including the
reason for our changes.  The second is a revision-marking of the September
15 proposal to show all the specific changes, including some minor edits.
We have not included the tariff revisions to support this package, but will
provide them once we have a final agreement.  At this point, the changes to
the prior tariff drafts are straight forward.

Also attached is a draft Joint Motion for your review and approval.  Our
suggested approach is to have Settlement Parties sign the motion as the
means of signifying their approval of the Settlement and the need for
expeditious Commission action.

We have scheduled a Settlement Conference next week on Tuesday, September
28, starting at 10:00 a.m. in Room 308, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco.
HOWEVER, the attendance of a couple key parties is problematic, and we may
need to move this settlement meeting to accommodate their schedules so we
can ensure a productive day.  We will advise you no later than Monday
morning of the meeting status and possible next steps.

We appreciate your continued active participation in this settlement process
and look forward to your feedback on our modifications.

Sincerely,



Dan Thomas

2,"This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

In the meantime, I'll try to get more information about questions he would like to ask. I doubt that I will have any success in that effort.

Dow Jones Newswires
Calif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy Suits
Dow Jones Newswires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday
he is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energy
suppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity.

But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigation
he has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he has
discovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibiting
overcharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time.

Lockyer's disclosure came a week after the state's top law enforcement
official sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling and
forcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection.

The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area to
overcome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press.

""We've devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get back
the money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added.

Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his office
has subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Reliant
Energy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorney
general did mention Enron by name, saying ""we're still looking at the energy
overcharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.

Enron, a major energy trading concern, has filed for bankruptcy protection
following the disclosure that it misstated its earnings by hundreds of
millions of dollars.

PG&E, the only supplier Lockyer has sued, blamed its woes on a 1996
California law that left it unable to collect the full price of electricity
from its customers.

Lockyer's disclosure that he hasn't discovered criminal conduct, including
no evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices, comes nearly a year after he said
he wanted to jail Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman. Lockyer told the Wall
Street Journal in May that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8
by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is
Spike, honey.""'

On Wednesday, Lockyer declared the statement ""rhetorical excess,"" adding,
""So far...we haven't found criminal behavior associated with pricing
policies.""

Still, the city of San Francisco has accused 13 energy suppliers of
manipulating prices in a suit that is pending in San Diego County Superior
Court.

That suit alleges the suppliers manipulated supplies to keep prices high.
San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Mark Slavin said the city doesn't have
proof of those allegations, but would uncover them as the lawsuit proceeds
in a process known as discovery.

""We think that the discovery process will uncover anticompetitive behavior,""
Slavin said.

The energy suppliers have denied the allegations.

A California legislative committee also investigating a spike in wholesale
energy costs has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the
Wholesale Energy Market summoned Enron officials to appear for depositions
regarding destruction of documents. Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, and the
committee's chairman, said he's concerned that documents destroyed by
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, were covered by a legislative subpoena
issued in June.

Dunn's committee on Wednesday also agreed to subpoena Andersen regarding the
Enron records.

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

each Power 2000 speaker within the next two weeks. Initially, I would  like 
to provide you with advanced notice of the event and wish to clarify some  
issues.

What current industry developments merit streams or pre/post conference  
seminars at EPRM 2001?

What research are you or your company involved in that would justify  
inclusion in EPRM 2001?

Aside from your own work, what subjects are currently at the  cutting-edge of 
energy risk management?

Who else would you recommend as a potential speaker? (Regulatory bodies,  
academics, practitioners)

Any assistance at this initial stage of research is  appreciated. You can

To PIRA's Retainer Service Clients,
Attached are two strategic reports on the telecom industry that address the
burgeoning market for bandwidth and the implications for the energy
industry.
The first report, ""BROADBAND OR DEADBAND: An Appraisal of the Fledgling
Bandwidth Commodity Market,"" focuses on trading in the wholesale broadband
market.  To assist readers in navigating this report (as well as the second
report) a short glossary of terms can be found in its Appendix.
The second report, ""THE DASH FOR CASH: Lucrative Opportunities to Provide
High-Speed Internet Access,"" focuses on the means by which consumers will
access this communications capacity and some strategic opportunities for
energy companies.
We hope you find these reports useful and strategically provocative.  After
investing great effort in becoming conversant in this area, it is clear to
us at PIRA that the energy marketplace will be forever changed by the demand
for, and creation of, substantial broadband.  What is NOT clear to us at
this time is how we can best assist our clients that are looking to
participate in these developments.  In light of that, we ask that you take a
moment to complete the brief survey that is also attached to this email.
Thank you.
Sincerely,

The PUCT ruled today that the utilities' excess earnings balance will be 
credited to the wires...amortized over 7 years with 7.5% interest beginning 
Jan 1, 2002.  (Trueup was not until 2004).  Utilities are unhappy however, 
this is the direction the commission had indicated they were heading a few 
weeks ago.  The excess earnings total over $6 billion dollars (new numbers 
came out today).  

I visited with Rep. Turner today after the commission's ruling, AECT set up a 
meeting with him to cut a deal.  Our commitment with Turner is that he will 
not harm the headroom created in SB 7 and subsequent PUCT decisions.  Turner 
was not completely happy with the commission's order because he was hoping 
for a larger refund check to rate payers.  Our amendment to HB 2107 (which 
refunds the excess earnings to the wires) is in line with the commission's 
decision.  When we signed on board with Turner, he said that if we stood with 
him, he would protect our interest.  Thank you for letting us get on board 
with him.  The IOUs are trying to cut a deal with him and because we stood 
with him...our interest should come first (as he has stated). 

During the HB 2107 committee hearing in March, Baker (TXU)  indicated that 
excess earnings should be returned to the wires (in 2004 trueup).  (I am 
getting the transcript of that hearing in the morning to confirm my memory).  

In a hearing on Nov 8, 2000 at the PUCT, Shaeffer ( Reliant) testified ""We 
believe that if we overrecover stranded investment, that we're going to 
refund the dollars down to the book value"".  Of course he meant during the 
2004 trueup, however, with the overcollection reaching $6 billion - and with 
today's commission ruling - a refund of the overcollection before 2004 is 
inevitable.  

Chairman Wolens (off the record) indicated today that HB 2107 would go to 
conference.  I think it is safe to infer he thinks the bill will pass the 
House and move to the Senate.  Turner has worked the Black Caucus, Hispanic 
Caucus and the Democratic Caucus.  

Rep. Counts (West Texas Conservative D) stood with Turner at the press 
conference along with Rep. Bailey and Rep. Hodge...each of them advocated for 
a refund of the overcollection.  (At the press conference Turner stated that 
he would drop his bill and wait until the 2004 trueup if the utilities would 
agree to keep everyone's lights on until the 2004 trueup.) The bill is likely 
to be heard on the House floor next Tuesday.

I did not provide comments/quotes to Fort Worth Star Telegram...they were 
told I was at the Capitol at a hearing.  I am working on a formal statement 
and gathering the support of other market participants with our interest to 
sign on.  I will run that by you before anything goes out. 

Thus far, Enron, Calpine, New Energy, Strategic,  and Excelon are willing to 
publically support our amendment to HB 2107.  (Others are supporting it but 
won't come out of the closet because they fear the utilities.) We are talking 
to Shell on Friday.  (They got confused and are supporting the bill as 
filed...which hurts headroom...they like our amendment but want to talk 
Friday before supporting it.)  

Thanks for your help with this, Jean 
"
1,"FYI - I will be out of the office for the two meetings on Wednesday this 
week.  I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week.  I will be 
back in the office on Wednesday of next week. 

Todd tells me that a logo has been selected.  Can you e:mail that to me?  If 
not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next 
Wednesday.   

If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process 
and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back 
in the office next week.  My first move will be to sit down with Jeff 
Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours 
that James Scribner sent you.  When we look at numbers of confirmations and 
compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which 
activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed  
to absorb increased business more easily.  I also think that Jeff will be the 
best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to 
simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally.  All of the 
advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, 
auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm 
group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for 
implementation.  No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.

    Let me review where we stand for the April 10-11 meeting.
1.  I have spoken with Gavyn and asked him to add to his usual review 
comments on the significance of recent developments for Enron.
2.  I have asked Bill Kristol to do the same.
3.  I have asked Paul Portney to review ""the lay of the land"" in the 
environmental policy area.
4.  Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, 
now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the 
best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief 
talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on 
this subject.
5.  I couldn't get anyone on the ""monopoly-too-big-and-powerful"" question, 
although I am still trying.
I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply 
picture. Have we heard from the author of ""When Genius Fails""?

Subject: Proposed Enron/Petron ISDA documentation

Hi Sara,

How are things with you, m'dear?  Have you any exotic destinations planned 
for this year's vacation?

Anyway - I'm planning to go on vacation with my family (yah - it's weird to 
say ""family"" now!)  to Perth from Thursday 23 September through to Saturday 3 
October and was wondering whether you could help 'babysit' the Petron 
matter.  Janice had mentioned that you'd done some due diligence on ISDA in 
the Philippines a year or so ago so I thought that you would probably be the 
most appropriate person to look after this matter in my absence.  Matt, who 
is a new attorney who joined us in the Singapore office last week, will also 
be keeping track of this file but he hasn't been fully 'Enronized' by Tana as 
yet (tho' he will be so before Thanksgiving as he'll be headed to Houston 
next month for a month's stint there) so I thought it best if you could be 
the main contact person for Petron as well as for our business folks during 
that week that I'm not around.  I really hope that you don't mind.

Assuming that you're OK with this, I would like to give your name and contact 
details to the Enron AP/A/CHI biz folks who are handling this - Manuel 
Gallego in the Philippines, Victor Santos who is presently relocating to 
Singapore and David Terlip to whom they report.  The traders in the Singapore 
office, John Chismar and Eng Wang Moi , will be providing the pricing.  Matt 
and my assistant, Angeline, will get hold of you should they hear from Petron 
during that week.  The plan is that Petron is interested in entering into 
some crack spread swaps with us.  So far, Citibank and Chase have signed up 
ISDAs with Petron.

In the meantime, I'll have Angeline fax to you copies of all the 
correspondence which I've had had with our Filipino counsel QTE to-date so 
that you'll get a good idea of what the regulatory and legal environment's 
like now in the Philippines. [Angeline - can you please do that today.  
Sara's fax no. is Houston Legal's fax no.]

So far, QTE has reviewed our draft ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex and 
I sent it across to Petron's inhouse counsel on 8 September (please see 
attached) and I'm now waiting for their written comments on those drafts.  

Please let me know whether you'll be able to look after this matter for me.  
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks a mill,
Anita

""What's Real About Real Options"" 


Tuesday April 24th 2001
6:30 PM
Wells Fargo Room
Haas School of Business
UC Berkeley


Refreshments will be served
?
------------------------------------------------------------------  About the 
talk  By Jacob Sagi, Assistant Professor of Finance, Haas School of Business

 Martha Amram is one of the leading advocates of the real options approach to 
asset  valuation. The methodology originated as an economically sound way to  
calculate the value of an asset whose management requires sequential  
decision-making. For instance, a pharmaceutical company may wish to assess  
the value of a speculative research project that, after many stages, may  
result in a marketable drug. At each stage the company can decide to proceed  
along a number of routes: abandoning the project, moth balling it, or  
continuing on a variety of scales. Roughly speaking, the real options  
approach selects, from among a universe of possible sequential decision  
strategies, a single strategy that maximizes the present value of cash  
flows. The cash flows for each strategy are discounted for the risk that the  
strategy reflects and not by an ad hoc cost of capital discount factor.

A real options approach to valuation is especially useful when one is trying  
to decide whether to defer investment in a project (analogous to deciding  
whether an American Call option should be exercised), or when an asset  
embodies latent value due to future growth possibilities (e.g., internet  
firms). Although academicians have long been proponents of the technique,  
there is still a great deal of skepticism among practitioners. This is  
largely due to the fact that ""optimal"" decisions reached via a real options  
approach are sensitive to input variables that are not always known reliably  
(e.g., the probability that a drug will be deemed successful in human  
trials). Regardless, a growing number of firms are opting for the  
methodology. This is evidenced by an increase in the number of consulting  
firms who employ or specialize in real options analyses.

Tuesday's speaker, Martha Amram, is the author of an important book on the  
subject, ""Real Options: Managing Strategic Investments in an Uncertain  
World,"" as well as recent articles in the Journal of Business Strategy,  
Harvard Business Review and Journal of Applied Corporate Finance. She has  
extensive consulting experience and is frequently invited to speak on the  
subject of real options. Although some in the business community have  
recently branded real options valuations a fad, academicians, like myself,  
would contend that the methodology is an important tool that is here to  
stay. I therefore encourage all students to come to the talk and learn more  
about the advantages and disadvantages of this much-talked-about concept.

2,"Beth Perlman tells me that you are in charge on this system.  It does not 
work.  I thought that this was going to be corrected last week.  I am 
confused about why we are using a system that does not work.  I understand 
that there are bugs in the system.  Was the system tested before being put 
into production?  

I tried to reach you by phone.  You were unavailable and I could not leave a 
voice mail because that was full.  I talked with Torey Hayden and verbally 
okayed the access for Bob Hall.  

Please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and 
how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system 
is not functioning.  You might at least put a contact name and number on 
these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system 
is fixed.  

My number is 35926.  I look forward to hearing from you on solutions and 
timing.

SCE Responds to PG&E Bankruptcy Filing

Southern California Edison Company (SCE) released the following statement in 
response to the decision today by Pacific Gas and Electric to file for 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This statement
is by Edison International Chairman, President, and CEO John Bryson. 

ROSEMEAD, Calif., April 6 /PRNewswire/ -- This is a sad day for California. 
PG&E has had a proud history of service to our state for more than a century.

We at Southern California Edison continue to believe that working out a 
comprehensive solution to our current crisis is a preferable course to take. 
PG&E's decision today does not change our position. 
Based in Rosemead, Calif., Edison International (NYSE: EIX) is a premier 
international electric power generator, distributor and structured finance 
provider.

Subject: Recruiting at CMU Computational Finance Program



Vince,

Greetings!  I am the director of the MS in Computational Finance program at
Carnegie Mellon.  I am following up on a conversation I had with Kevin
Kindall, a graduate of our program, who gave me your e-mail address and
suggested I contact you as the individual making the recruiting decisions
for the Research Group at Enron.

In speaking with the director of the Career Opportunity Center at the
business school, I am told that although an Alison Bailey from Enron
(mary.alison.bailey@enron.com) has arranged for a sizable block of rooms in
which to conduct interviews on campus on December 11th, there is as yet no
indication of whether the Comp Finance students will have opportunity to
compete for these spaces.

We are regarded by many in the industry as the top quantitative finance
program in the country.  Focused on derivative pricing, econometrics, VAR
and portfolio management, our graduates should be an excellent fit for your
business.  I would be happy to talk with you further about our
rogram( http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/) as well as our students' interest
in Enron (the name comes up a lot!).  Also, if you are interested, we run a
""Speaker Series""  on most Friday's during the fall and spring that would
give you (or another in your group) the opportunity to address our students
in an area of interest.  Such a meeting would, I think, help you better
understand the careers our students are preparing to pursue as well as give
our students first hand knowledge of Enron and its future.

When might be a good time to contact you by telephone?

Thank you for your time.

Rick

2,"Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would ""file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA"" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  

Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

2,"I would like to move forward with what we are calling Phase III for EOL.  Most of the work is done but in this environment, I don't want to prepare to roll it out in January without your views.  However, if we are to roll it out in mid-January, we need to agree soon.
 
Richter has sent you the outline/presentation on e-mail and he and Savita and Jay can describe it all in greater detail if you like. 
 
Savita discussed the presentation and the plan with John Arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality. 
 
Basically it will include a new home page and a new garden page, but the key parts are the expanded quotes screen and the order manager which are a much better use of real estate than the static Reuters content down the side (which will be put in a MyContent button).  This isn't expensive, most of the work is done anyway, but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded.
 
I think it would be positive to do.  It looks better, the Reuters content can be found in a MyContent button and we can use the entire quotes screen to enhance order flow and improve the counterparty experience.  It also shows business as usual with EnronOnline.
 
Your thoughts?

I'm still filling in cites and Bernadette will be working on the formatting, but the document is hopefully in pretty good shape.  There is no filing deadline for these comments, but we would like to submit them on Monday if possible.  It shouldn't take more than an hour to review.  In sending your comments, please ""Reply to All"" so everyone receives your comments.

Subject: PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

to a 41.67 heat rate.  We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I 
guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.  
Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on 
Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.  What about a forecast for this November 
loads.

Let me know what you think.





Phillip"
2,"Ben,

I know you want to put Certosa Holdings on the back burner for a while but 
unfortunately we can't stop the process unless we withdrawal our request for 
unusual use permit.   If we do so, we can not re-submit for 18 months.   
Since the application was submitted in the name of Certosa Holdings, if the 
property is conveyed to another entity, it may be possible to re-submit under 
this new entity.  I've asked Kay to look into the possibility if throwing 
Certosa Holdings into bankruptcy.  I have not heard back but here are my 
thoughts:
 (1) We are not a creditor and therefore we may not have the ability to put 
CH in bankruptcy
 (2) If we can deem CH in default of the option agreement,  one of the 
remedies is reimbursement.  Since CH is illiquid, we would automatically be a 
creditor with the       ability to throw them into bankruptcy
 (3) Once in bankruptcy, I don't know what would happen.  There are no 
secured creditors and we would be the only unsecured creditor.  
 (4) Whether bankruptcy would halt the unusual use permit approval process or 
not, I do not know. 
Until we determine if bankruptcy helps, us we have no choice but to proceed.

I estimate the burn rate will be between $50,000 and $60,000 per month 
through October.  This is broken down into four types of costs:
 (a) lobbyists: $17,000 per month from June through October plus $210,000 in 
success fees if we get project approval from the commissioners.
 (b) yet to be negotiated option consideration:  $20k to $35k to Certosa 
Holdings as well as an adjacent property owner looking for a buyout
 (c) land fill closure related activities: $35,000 (ground water testing, 
fencing the property and funding assistance to get $800,000 of bond money 
released to reimburse       closure costs)
 (d) Consultants and lawyers: $23,000 per month

  
As you know we are now out of the jurisdiction of the CZAB and in the 
jurisdiction of the Board of County Commissioners.  Below is a summary of 
where we are and where we need to go.  Please let me know when you have a few 
minutes to discuss this project.

Renew or New Option Agreement:
We need to renegotiate the Option Agreement with Certosa Holdings:  Rather 
than giving CH a chunk of money that could disappear immediately, I'd like to 
structure an arrangement where we fund, as long as the Option Agreement is in 
effect (we don't terminate before expiration), some landfill closure work.  
This benefits both Enron and CH as DERM will be more amenable to amending the 
Consent Agreement that sets out the time table of closure if they can see 
some progress.  I an trying to get with Kay to discuss alternatives.  We need 
to be aware that CH could file bankruptcy sooner or later.  I checked the 
Option Agreement and unlike some of the other agreements, this one does not 
appear to have bankruptcy as a default.  If we have to give CH anything I 
would want to give him only a nominal amount of money;  $25k max

Option on adjacent property:
As referenced above, we (Kerri) have been contacted  by an attorney 
representing a property owner adjacent to the CH site who may be looking for 
a buy out.  The property is wetlands and should be relatively cheap 
considering it is useless.

Unusual Use Permit Application and Claim of Taking:
We expect to present the project and argue the taking issue before the 
Development of Impact Committee (""DIC"") in July.  This is a committee of 
County Department heads.  They will make a recommendation to the Board of 
County Commissioners who will hear the merits of the project and decide on 
whether to approve the project.  Only if they reject the project does the 
taking issue come into play.  I will work to target the Board of County 
Commissioners hearing for October.  

You are aware of the ordinance we propose to discuss with the Commissioners.  
I'd like to talk to you about this when you have time. 

DERM (Department of Environmental Resource Management) issues:
When we executed this option agreement, we fully expected CH to have closed 
the landfill by now.  Obviously things have changed.  

We (Kerri, Valorie Settles of Shutts & Bowen and I) met DERM last week.  DERM 
is willing to consider revising the Consent Agreement and the schedule of 
closing the landfill.  We discussed creating a 3 phase closure.  the first 
phase would be the easy (cheap) stuff as discussed above.  The second phase 
would be more expensive and may include removal of a pile of wood for $171k 
and or removal of exotics from the wetlands for $83k.  The second phase would 
be times to occur after we received County Commissioners approval for the 
Unusual Use Permit.  The third phase would be the very expensive stuff ($ 
millions) and would be timed to be when we expect to exercise the option.

Consultant Agreements for Lobbyists:
We have been working with one lobbyist, whose contract expired at the end of 
May.  Another, a former chief of staff of the commissionwer whose district 
the project is in, publishes a newspaper called the Gospel Truth, which 
recently published an article about the project and the need for power"

Orange County/State briefs: Truckee firm offers cut-rate electricity

August 16, 2000

Orange County Register

A Truckee company is selling electricity for 8 cents per kilowatt hour, far
less than what many south Orange County residents have been paying this
summer. TenderLand Power Co. will guarantee the flat rate for a year,
starting Oct. 1, for up to 60,000 customers. That equates to roughly 5
percent of all the customers now using San Diego Gas & Electric Co.

This week, SDG&E is selling electricity for 17.6 cents per kilowatt hour.

Residents may want to wait before switching, because a cut in SDG&E bills
could be in the offing, said Jodi Beebe at the Utility Consumers' Action
Network in San Diego.

TenderLand Invites 60,000 Electricity Customers to Opt Out of Electric Rate
Crisis

08/15/2000

Business Wire

(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

TRUCKEE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 15, 2000--TenderLand Power Company
has invited 60,000 California electricity customers on a first-come,
first-served basis to choose TenderLand, receive a flat electric generation
rate, and stand up for their right under deregulation to switch away from
San Diego Gas & Electric, thereby completely opting out of the rate crisis
being experienced by SDG&E customers.

In response to the high electric rates in San Diego, the California
Legislature as well as the California Public Utilities Commission has
proposed laws and procedures which create a deferred payment plan disguised
as a lower, or ""frozen"" fixed electric rate plan. The proposed directives
may require even those electric customers who switch or plan to switch from
SDG&E to pay for the costs of this ""electric rate loan"" whether or not they
receive their power from an alternative electric service provider like
TenderLand. Clearly, such a situation would infringe upon the rights of
electric ratepayers participating in a deregulated electricity market, as
they may still be forced to pay added costs for expensive energy purchased
by their local electricity distribution utility (like SDG&E) and consumed by
the utility's own customers.

""TenderLand views this possible situation as unfair to ratepayers who have
benefited by deregulation and exercised their right to choose, or plan to
choose an alternative electric service provider,"" said TenderLand Chief
Financial Officer Ken Keddington. ""TenderLand is committed to taking all
possible action to protect its customers from these possible additional
costs while providing a renewable energy option.""

""When California electricity customers choose TenderLand to receive
renewable power at a true flat electric generation rate, they will also join
TenderLand's crusade against passing added costs to those who want to opt
out of the statewide electric rate crisis, especially noticeable in San
Diego, by switching to alternative electric service providers.""

The flat rate offer is limited to the first 60,000 new residential and
commercial customers who sign up with TenderLand. For more information, call
toll free at: 877/872-0932, or sign up on TenderLand's website at
www.TenderLand.com.

TenderLand Power Company, Inc. provides its customers with 100% renewable
power and is committed to furthering the development of new renewable
generation nationwide. The company is headquartered in Truckee, Calif.,
began retail operations in April 1999, and serves customers throughout most
of California.

Joan,

The BOA ticket was established by John Griffith.

Two deal tickets are necessary for St. Mary's in order to segregate that 
portion of the excess volumes on which a firm delivery guarantee to the East 
Desk was made and origination was taken from that portion of the excess 
volumes which are delivered to the desk on an interruptible basis and priced 
accordingly.

George,

There should not be a deal tic for BOA [55941].  The Brazos tic #541136 has 
100% of the VPP vols, which is correct.  The other tic should not exist.  I 
am not sure if you put this in, or if John Griffith did this when the name 
change from St. Mary's to Brazos took place.  Please let me know what I need 
to do in order to get this removed/corrected. 

Also, when things slow down, we need to discuss the 2 deal tics [firm and 
spot].  Per the contract with Preston, there s/b only one tic - all the gas 
at IF TGT + 0.0025.

Subject: Teco's Indian Spring Plant

A meeting was held on November 1, 2000 at 3 pm in EB3270 to resolve Exxon's 
residue volume issue at Teco's Indian Spring Plant.   Exxon's issue is that 
the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for 
transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to 
PGE.   

Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved:

 1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line 
attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production.
 2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis 
elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects 
to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL.
 3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco 
can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes. 
 4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate 
the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue 
to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must 
pay to Teco an additional $500 per month.

Solution:
 1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884 
that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line.
 2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL

 3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset 
volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes.
 4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack 
Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d.

If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please 
let me know at X-36650.

Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served 
on EECC on April 10

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

		 Subject: Statement on Energy Crisis


I have prepared a statement on the California energy crisis in response to
a solicitation from the Wall Street Journal, and attach a preliminary first
draft in pdf and Wordperfect formats.  This may or may not appear in some
edited form as an op-ed piece in the WSJ.  Although this statement is in
my own words, I believe it is consistent with the Manifesto.  I would
appreciate feedback from my fellow economists if I have made statements that
contradict the Manifesto, or most critically have made arguments that they
feel are not sound economics.  I will try to incorporate suggestions in the
next draft.  Thanks for your reaction.

I am also sending copies of this draft to a couple of people in the media
other than the WSJ, and they are welcome to use the content but not the text
if they want a summary of my take on the crisis.

Subject: UPDATE ON QF DISCUSSIONS IN DC

Late Sat. night, the Principles Group met to  discuss the status of the 
overall progress made in various DC working  groups.? At that time, it was 
clear that a number of outstanding issues  remained unresolved, including the 
issue of ""credit worthiness"" going forward,  forbearance of past amounts due, 
and what program (if any) would resolve the  utilities' cash position while 
maintaining reliability.? Discussions are  continuing, and Tuesday is a 
critical deadline as the utilities (particulalry  SCE) has a large payment 
due that date.
?
The California legislature is developing  legislation to address some, or all 
the issues required, including we have heard  QF SRAC payment reform.
?
Regarding QF issues, reform of the QF energy  payments is viewed by many as a 
critical means to increase the utilities' cash  position.? While no 
resolution of that matter was reached as of end of day  Saturday, Governor 
Davis indicated during the Principles meeting that the CPUC  was going to 
render a decision on Thursday this week to address that  matter.? Most people 
inferred from this comment that the CPUC would take up  the Wood PD or some 
modification of that PD.? 
?
IEP believes that the approval of the Wood PD (or  an alternate) creates 
serious procedural questions and legal questions.? We  are drafting comments 
to the Wood PD which will be filed on Monday or Tuesday  which will address 
these issues.? In addition, Jan spoke during the  Principles Group meeting on 
Saturday, noting particularly that the Wood PD, if  voted out, would raise 
the spector of a significant amount of in-state  generation not able to 
operate, thereby raising significant reliability  concerns.
?
The QF working group addressing  modifications/reform of the existing SRAC 
payment structure was? not able  to reach consensus as of noon Sunday.? Talks 
are expected to continue with  the utilities on Monday, in San Francisco at 
11:00 a.m. at PG&E.? In  addition, given the signals from the governor and 
others, some QFs have  proceeded with bilateral discussions with their 
utility contract holders to work  out contract modifications/reforms on a 
bilateral basis.? 
?
[Note, I haven't yet checked all my emails, but I  believe we postponed the 
Friday Restructuring/Transmission conference call to  Monday, Jan 15 at 9:00 
a.m.? This will give us an opportunity to fully  brief you.

Title: Weathering the Summer Price Volatility and Highs--How Will Retail 
Marketers Fare?

**********************************************************************

This summer retail marketers have been confronted with extraordinarily 
difficult market circumstances for both gas and power. So far this summer, 
average weekly power prices have risen above $100 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 
several markets--almost double many of the standard offer levels. This 
differential between market prices and standard offers has made it almost 
impossible for retail marketers to offer customers an attractive service 
proposition in many areas of the United States open to competition. 
Similarly, in the gas market this summer (May through June) prices at the 
Henry Hub have averaged $3.92 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), well 
above the average of $2.62 per MMBtu during the same period last year. In 
some cases, the volatile gas and power markets this summer are proving lethal 
to retail marketers that chose to ride the spot markets rather than properly 
hedge their purchases and who lack the balance sheet strength to carry the 
burden. In addition, som!
e retail marketers have experienced difficulty with contract fulfillment by 
their wholesale suppliers, even when the retailer may have felt secure going 
into the summer. As a result of these market conditions, a few marketers have 
even relinquished their customers, returning them to the utilities who are 
the default suppliers.

Retail marketers serving these difficult markets (which include the West, 
PJM, and New England) are approaching the current situation with a number of 
different strategies, including

*  selling either part or all of their customer base

*  continuing to serve their existing customers but not renewing their 
contracts and planning to exit the market

*  turning customers back on utility service

*  continuing full steam ahead

The irony of this situation is that high prices over the next few years may 
actually help increase consumer awareness about competitive energy supplies 
and may even cause utilities under unrecoverable price cap rates to question 
whether they should remain in the merchant business. Uncertainties whether 
retail marketers can withstand these conditions and regulators and other 
interested parties will tolerate a sustained period of both high and volatile 
prices or if instead they will step in and adjust the rules in the name of 
protecting retail customers.

In this briefing CERA examines the question of whether one possible fallout 
from this summer's high and volatile energy prices will be increased 
consolidation among retail marketers, as retail customers (and/or businesses) 
begin to be actively bought and sold. We also examine the implications on 
retail markets of recent federal legislation supporting the legality of 
electronic contracts. In addition, we focus our first regional analysis on 
the regulatory developments and retail activity in the Northeast states and 
Canadian provinces--one of the most dynamic regions in terms of retail energy 
activity.

Retail Metrics

Trading Retail Customer Bases: Avenue for Building Market Share

Although the impact of volatile and high energy prices this summer may be 
bleak for many retail players, for a new entrant and/or contrarian buyer, 
this could be an excellent time to pick up customers ""on the cheap"" and build 
market share. In the past month there have been three notable cases of retail 
energy companies buying retail customer bases from other companies--in some 
cases just the retail customers have been purchased and in other cases whole 
retail energy businesses have been purchased. Examples include

*  North American market entry strategy. Centrica, an energy marketing 
business in the United Kingdom, purchased Direct Energy, an energy marketing 
business in Canada that also has a joint venture with Sempra called Energy 
America. Through its acquisition of Direct Energy, Centrica acquired 820,000 
Canadian gas customers and 27.5 percent ownership interest in Energy America, 
a US company that has 450,000 gas and power customers (see Table 1). In 
addition to gaining access to the largest retail customer base in North 
America, Centrica was able to buy a company with significant experience in 
various North American retail markets.

*  Gaining critical mass for an IPO. The New Power Company (a joint venture 
between Enron, IBM, and AOL) recently acquired over 300,000 gas and power 
customers from Columbia Energy Services as a way to quickly build market 
share before an initial public offering, for which a request has recently 
been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

*  Building market share. Energy America acquired 50,000 gas customers from 
Titan Energy, an energy marketer in Georgia, after the latter filed for 
bankruptcy.

In the two cases of bankruptcy, mass-market gas customers were purchased in 
the range of $44-$112 per customer. It appears that purchasing a base of 
retail customers is a cheaper form of buying market share than purchasing an 
entire company or division. For example, Centrica paid between $480 and $645 
per customer in its purchase of Direct Energy's business. This metric is 
somewhat misleading, however, as the purchase of Direct Energy also included 
upstream gas assets.

The three recent transactions join the list of retail customer acquisitions 
over the past year or two (see Table 1). These transactions are generally 
occurring for three common reasons: either as a result of a retail marketer 
bankruptcy (e.g., Titan Energy and Peachtree Gas), because companies are 
changing their strategic focus (e.g., NiSource/Columbia Energy and PG&E), or 
as a market entry tool (e.g., AES, Centrica, New Power). CERA expects many 
more players to consolidate and exit the business this year, particularly in 
the aftermath of the summer market.

The idea that the current climate might offer a good buying opportunity for 
retail customers has not been lost on the market. While existing retail 
markets are struggling to make ends meet, the number of marketers requesting 
certification has increased in some places such as Massachusetts, where it is 
expected these new entrants will attempt to purchase other marketers' 
businesses.

Table 1 shows extreme differences in prices paid for retail customer bases 
(on a total-cost-per-customer basis), since a wide variety of factors 
contribute to the cost of a customer and/or a retail business. CERA does not 
suggest that this table provides an apples-to-apples comparison on the cost 
of a customer. In terms of just pure customer acquisition costs there can be 
significant regional differences in the value of a customer owing to average 
use per customer and local market conditions. For example, a residential gas 
customer in Georgia will likely use far less gas than one in Michigan and 
should be valued differently as a result. Other factors such as buying 
habits, load size, existing contracts, and future potential growth in the 
market need to be evaluated to determine the proper valuation of customers. 
In addition, a myriad of factors can affect the value of a retail company, 
including what other capabilities, assets, and other factors are part of the 
deal, separat!
e from the customer base and underlying contracts.

Retail Market Share Consolidation Could Be the Trend over the Next Year

Although the buying and selling of retail customers through aggregators was a 
common feature of Ontario gas restructuring, this tactic has not been as 
prevalent in the United States for two reasons. Marketers have been 
distrustful of the methods of acquisition of other players and are therefore 
skeptical about the loyalty of customers if they were to be acquired through 
a purchase. Additionally, many have felt that they could acquire customers at 
a much lower cost than by purchasing an existing customer base.

This historical reluctance to buy retail customer bases seems to be changing, 
and will likely continue to change in the future. Over the past few years 
there has already been a maturation of many of these marketers and of the 
rules that they must obey. In addition, as larger name companies enter the 
retail markets, the risk associated with buying a customer base that had been 
acquired through questionable means has been drastically reduced.

With the emergence of significant players such as Enron, Centrica, and Shell 
into the retail market,  further customer buyouts will occur as these and 
other large players work to gain enough scale to make the retail business 
significant to their bottom line. The new breed of retail marketers may be 
better capitalized to play the short-run game of building market share as 
well as the long-run game. As a result, these players may be able to achieve 
scale in a market where no single company has achieved significant scale to 
date. In addition, many of these companies have strong wholesale marketing 
capabilities to support their retail marketing capabilities, inform their 
contracting practices, and help shield them from being on the wrong side of 
volatile markets.

Market Developments

New Law Removes the Wet Signature Barrier, but Lack of Uniform Rules Persists

The regulatory requirement for retail energy marketers to obtain written 
(""wet"") signatures from end users wanting to switch their energy service 
provider has posed a major cost barrier to marketers that already face high 
customer acquisition costs. As a result, a number of competitive energy 
marketers have exited markets with wet signature requirements. This cost 
barrier will be lowered in October when recently passed federal legislation 
takes effect--sparking renewed interest in the affected markets as well as 
guaranteeing that in the states scheduled to open, electronic customer 
sign-ups and transactions will be legally binding.

In late June, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Electronic 
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, which will take effect 
October 1, 2000. This law overrides state regulatory rulings and laws that 
have required wet signatures. However, although the news is a step forward 
for marketers, the issue is not entirely cut and dried.

*  The Act confirms the legality of electronic transactions, while giving the 
states broad authority on how to implement and judge requirements for these 
transactions.

*  It stipulates that parties engaged in transactions must both agree to 
conduct commerce electronically. This act neither mandates electronic 
commerce nor allows it to be mandated if not agreed to.

*  The Act follows on an earlier act titled the Uniform Electronic 
Transactions Act (UETA), which was proposed last year by the National 
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. For the states that 
adopted this earlier Act, the latest Congressional legislation allows them to 
adhere to the UETA. States that have not implemented the UETA will be under 
the jurisdiction of the new federal legislation, which is slightly more open 
to interpretation than the UETA.

What does this legislation mean at the state level? Unfortunately, this Act 
did not come in time to have a significant impact on the states that have 
troubled marketers (e.g., Arizona and New Jersey). Prior to the passing of 
this new legislation, Arizona adopted its own version of the UETA in April. 
Almost concurrent with the federal legislation, New Jersey recently approved 
an Internet pilot program to allow marketers to use electronic signatures to 
switch customers beginning in September. The program will be open to 350,000 
customers (10 percent of the market) and will last for six months before 
reevaluation by the Board of Public Utilities (BPU). However, in lieu of the 
federal legislation, the BPU will vote in August on lifting the program cap. 
It remains to be seen if either the pilot or new rules will be sufficient to 
lure back the marketers (e.g., KeySpan, DTE, Conectiv) that pulled out of New 
Jersey over the past year, citing the state's wet signature rules as one of!
 the primary reasons for their exit. Given the high use and ownship of 
personal computers in the residential market, as well as customer interest in 
being able to shop for suppliers over the Internet (about one third of 
customers surveyed in New Jersey supported Internet sign-up), we expect this 
recent ruling could jump-start marketing to the mass market this fall.

This legislation will have the most significant impact in states that have 
not opened to competition or ruled on wet signatures. Although benefiting all 
marketers by increasing their options, this Act benefits pure e-commerce 
players the most. The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be 
substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail 
(whose costs include paper and postage) or door-to-door sales (which involves 
high labor costs). Since many consumers will continue to remain without 
Internet service for the midterm, another implication of the ruling is that 
it will drive further customer segmentation by different types of marketers.

The implementation of the electronic signature law may signal the advent of 
the Internet as a favored marketing tool over the more traditional means of 
marketing to customer through paid advertising, direct mail, or door-to-door 
sales. Since the Act does not require states to accept oral communication as 
legally binding, many states will continue to require written or electronic 
signatures. ""Slamming"" and ""cramming"" remain the concern of many state 
regulators, resulting in rules that disallow oral transactions as a means of 
signing customers.

The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less 
than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail (whose costs include 
paper and postage) or door-to-door sales (which involve high labor costs). 
This will help divide the retail market into players serving different 
customer segments. One set will continue to acquire customers that do not 
have Internet access through traditional methods, whereas the other set of 
retail players will acquire and conduct business over the Internet, typically 
gaining higher income customers.

Though there can be little question that states will eventually have to allow 
marketers to transact and acquire customers over the Internet, the 
state-by-state rules governing electronic transactions are likely to continue 
to be nonstandard. Although the intent of the law as it is written is to 
nullify state wet signature legislation in all but a few cases, there could 
be some confusion over its interpretation at the state level. One area to 
watch will be how states interpret one of the law's few exceptions--that 
customers must be notified in a nonelectronic format when their utility 
service is being terminated. Some regulatory agencies may take that to mean 
that when consumers switch away from utility service, some form of 
communication must be sent to the consumer, and potentially a regulatory 
commission could require marketers to bear some or all of these costs.

Regional Analysis--Northeast Market

The attention being given to the high-priced summer market of 2000 is masking 
what could be seen as small steps forward for competition in the Northeast. 
Despite headlines about retail players exiting some markets and customers 
being returned to system supplies, state regulatory activity is proceeding 
apace this year, and there continues to be a steady influx of new players 
that are waiting for certification in states such as Massachusetts and New 
Jersey. Still, this has not been a banner year for retail activity in the 
Northeast (see Figure 1 and Table 2).

Regulatory Front

The region has more competitive retail power markets open than any other in 
the United States. Of the nine states in the Northeast, only New Hampshire 
and Vermont have not been opened to competition, although both states are 
moving forward to break the political impasse there. Maine and Connecticut 
have opened since January.

Although natural gas competition got off to an early start in the region, it 
now lags electric access, with only New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey 
technically open to gas competition to all customers. Over the next year, the 
only state that is expected to take any significant step forward on the gas 
front is Massachusetts, as the Department of Telecommunications and Energy 
(DTE) is likely to rule in favor of opening the market to all customers by 
the end of the year.

There has been a decrease in the number of customers in some utility 
jurisdictions that are competitively buying gas and power in the Northeast 
since March, particularly in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Since March the 
number of customers switched to retail marketers has dropped from 612,000 to 
547,000 for gas and increased somewhat for power from 680,000 customers to 
801,000. Although new competitors continue to petition for the right to serve 
in a number of northeastern states, in a few of the newly opened access 
states, retailers have been slow to step forward with competitive offers. 
This is particularly true for offers directed to residential and small 
commercial customers.

Wholesale Volatility

Market share of retail players in the Northeast has always remained highly 
fragmented, and utility affiliates retain the bulk of deregulated market 
share. This is poised to change over the next year, as some of the early 
retail marketers experiencing difficulty under the current market conditions 
pull back, leaving room for new entrants on the sidelines. In many of the 
states, wholesale prices this summer dramatically exceeded the level of 
competitive offers in the marketplace, exceeding $100 MWh in some cases in 
New England. A few retailers caught without a secure supply of wholesale 
power were forced to return their customers to the provider of last resort 
service. It will be important to watch these markets in the fall to see if 
customers return to these marketers and/or whether the regulators adjust the 
rules to prohibit this kind of behavior and/or fix the rules that perpetuate 
this discrepancy between the standard offer and market price.

Until the wave of new supply resources are built and brought online in these 
markets, high and volatile prices are likely to be a characteristic of this 
market. It remains to be seen if retailers will have learned the lessons from 
this past summer, however, and go into the next peak period with firm supply 
contracts as well as arm themselves with the marketing savvy to take 
advantage of customer aversion to high and fluctuating prices with offers of 
a stable price, while providing the marketer with a significant margin above 
the wholesale price.

The story is similar for gas, as CERA expects strong gas prices in the 
Northeast to continue for the new few years, until increased supply comes 
into the market. High prices will continue, owing to tight storage 
inventories and increased demand for gas for power generation, with last 
winter's volatility likely to be repeated in upcoming winters.

Canada

The largest Canadian market in the Northeast is Quebec, as Ontario will be 
covered as part of our Midwest regional analysis. The Quebec gas market is 
the only northeastern Canadian gas or power market fully open to competition. 
There is no investigation into power competition in Quebec at this time. It 
is likely that Quebec will wait and see how opening of the Ontario power 
market plays out next year before taking any action, just as it watched and 
repeated the Ontario gas market experience.

Greenfield gas distribution companies are being built in New Brunswick and 
Nova Scotia, which will be served by Sable Island gas supplies. The 
regulatory focus there is to encourage hooking customers up to gas system 
supplies, not necessarily to promote retail competition.

Subject: Summary of HB 2107

The Texas statute allows for full collection of stranded costs with a final 
determination of stranded costs in 2004 and interim collection in 2002 and 
2003 based on a Commission estimate.  The Commission bases its estimate of 
stranded costs on the ECOM (Excess Costs Over Market) Model.  The ECOM model 
computes the difference between the revenues a utility would receive in a 
regulated environment versus the revenues a utility would receive if it sold 
all of its generation at market prices (the market price in the ECOM Model is 
based on a Combined Cycle Combustion Turbine). 

In 1998 the Commission estimated more than $4 Billion in stranded costs based 
on the ECOM Model.  Because stranded costs are the difference between the 
market value and the book value of utility generating assets, the Commission 
ordered utilities to ""mitigate"" stranded costs by increasing depreciation of 
generating assets.  The accelerated depreciation, came from two sources:

 1. Redirected depreciation -- Utilities were allowed to defer depreciation 
of their wires assets and increase depreciation on generating assets; and,
 2. Application of Excess Earnings -- instead of decreasing utility rates the 
Commission set a cap on earnings and directed the utilities to apply any 
earnings above the cap to depreciating generating assets.

Because of the unexpected rise in natural gas prices the market price in the 
ECOM model rose significantly above the weighted average price of the 
regulated side which is weighted by coal and nuclear.  This caused the 2001 
estimate of stranded costs to be severely negative.  Even more negative than 
the amounts of redirected depreciation and application of excess earnings.

Enron argued at the Commission that because the estimate of stranded cost was 
negative the accelerated depreciation was unnecessary.  Consequently, we 
argued that the money spent on mitigation should be used to reduce wires 
rates.  The utilities argued that they should keep mitigation until the final 
determination of stranded costs in 2004.  The Commission ruled in Enron's 
favor.  

Sylvester Turner filed H.B. 2107 to address this situation, however, rather 
than simply reducing wires charges, the bill as filed would reduce utility 
rates making it more difficult to compete.  We are working to amend the bill 
so that the credit for redirected depreciation and excess earnings goes only 
to reducing wires rates and that any negative stranded costs beyond that 
amount would be refunded directly to ratepayers.

1,"Brent, Andrea and I had a ""status"" conversation this afternoon.  Brent will 
go to Sao Paulo on July 20 to meet with Andrea, Randy and commercial people.  
Andrea has requested that you and I go to Brazil after July 28 when the 
outside lawyer is back from vacation.  In general, the three of us are 
conforming and updating physical resolutions (final and proposed) and 
identifying additional research necessary to address the financial trading 
issues.  These are related to specific deals originating in Brazil (which are 
truly settled financially, e.g., a purported prepay where no physical 
commodity was to be delivered) and issues arising here in Houston (e.g., the 
Hickerson request for fixed income, FX and equity trading).  Brent will be 
discussing pending transaction structures while in Sao Paulo. 

It appears  that Brent is the ""point person"" for dealing directly with the 
Sao Paulo office and he will bring me in as necessary (although I will be 
dealing frequently with Andrea).

Jonny,

Wow what a week.  I still can't believe it.  I will have the video in mail
overnight on Monday.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you got another
copy and don't need it.

Thanks again for the tickets and for driving.  It was fun being with Trey.
I hope B is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating
Madeline's birthday.  I can't believe you have a teenager.  We are getting
old.

I was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned
the price of the ticket.  $175!  I didn't realize that when you gave it to
me.  I really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us.  I
didn't mind his hospitality at $50 bucks but i simply didn't realize they
were that much -  I 've never been to the big dance before.  If your dad
wasn't comped the tickets from OU, Mark and I would like to reimburse him.

Please let me know the situation.

Cheers and Boomer Sooner,

Subject: El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings 
Per Share


http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000711/tx_el_paso_2.html

Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time
Company Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation
El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share
HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG
<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today
announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,
an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share
of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding
for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second
quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million
in the year-ago period.
EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the
quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.
``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in
our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said
William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy
Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio
of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to
accelerate in the second quarter.''
For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share
increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first
six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding
non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515
million in the year-ago period.
Second Quarter Business Segment Results
The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the
second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year
and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas
and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating
significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced
trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale
customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's
off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed
to the record second-quarter performance.
The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT
to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher
realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the
reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for
the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and
$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from
the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day
and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.
The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,
nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due
primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with
the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March
2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion
Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.
Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas
Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared
with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost
savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3
TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement
filed in March.
The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million
compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in
Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's
investment in the Philippines.
Telecom Update
``We have made substantial progress in the development of our
telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.
Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,
we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant
Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building
businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant
Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the
telecommunications marketplace.''
Quarterly Dividend
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on
the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October
2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September
1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.
With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides
comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern
Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy
International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso
Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas
pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has
operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power
generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing,
and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso
Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging
the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion
and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the
completion of regulatory reviews. Visit El Paso Energy's web site at

2,"Mark, I checked Global and two of the four contracts listed under ""last used"" 
are in ""executed"" status, MidCon 96006304 and Trading & Transportation 
96006708.
Energy Transfer 96008328 and Mieco 96008853 are ""documented"".  Please forward 
any contract files to Eric Gillaspie in Legal on 38.

So far, we have not been asked to provide storage contracts for the data 
room.  Of course, that is subject to change.  So we don't need the Cannon and 
Texas General Land Ks at this time.

Eric, it looks like there are four contracts that we are interested in 
terminating per Lauri's note.  

Let me know if I can be of assistance.

From : Vivek Menezes
To   : Mr. Kenneth L. Lay (klay@enron.com)
       Chairman & CEO,
       Enron Corp.

Dear Mr. Lay,

Further to my emails dated 22/2/2000 & 14/6/2000 introducing Tata Housing a=
s
a premium real estate developer in India, and specifically, our commercial
complex Technopolis KnowledgePark at Andheri (E), Mumbai.  We have been
given to understand  that Enron have acquired an additional space in  Kamla
Mills Compound.  We were surprised to note that Enron did not consider
Technopolis KnowledgePark inspite of it being a ready to move in building
with all the facilities required for a good Call Center.

A few of these facilities being -

_ High speed (100 MBPS)  data network with switched interconnection
      between offices.
_ Provision  for  ISDN lines.
_ 5000 line MTNL  exchange on campus
_ Power from Tata Electric Cos, which is 20% cheaper than the Government
      supply.
_ In addition,  a good quality restaurant and 24 hours ATM facility.
_ Central Air-conditioning & Building Automation System.

All these facilities and more were explained to Mr. Edward de Valcourt,
Project Director Communications, Enron Corp., when he visited Technopolis
KnowledgePark on 16/6/2000.  Inspite of that, we have once again not been
considered.  I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that we
currently have approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. of space available at
Technopolis KnowledgePark.  We are also in the process of constructing the
IInd Phase in the same complex which is approximately 60,000 sq.ft. and can
be made entirely available to you, if required.

Further, we have another building of approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. located
strategically at Kanjurmarg.  This too could be ideal for your requirement.
We would also like to inform you that Tata Housing has a large land bank an=
d
can offer properties to Enron for Call Centres  across the country.
We request you to once again look into the same and revert to us at the
earliest.

Thanking you
Yours sincerely,
TATA HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CO. LTD.

2,"Peter,

We need to provide wording to the auditors regarding the following:
1.	Notification wrt ""Trades in Error"" - Article 6.2
2.	Alternate data delivery procedures.

We have agreed to notify NGX verbally of any ""Trades in Error"" in a timely fashion.  Upon notification we would defer to Article 6.2 of the Alberta Price Index Methodology document.  NGX would take care of notifying industry participants and removing the trade from the indices.

With respect to alternate data delivery, we have agreed to provide the data electronically at least hourly.  The data will be provided to NGX in the XML format outlined in the interface document.

Would you please write up a couple paragraphs that outline our obligations.  If you have any questions please contact Mckay or myself.  TKS.

I am working with Joe Hunter to prepare the individual letters to our

these letters
out the door:

Bankers Trust Company

Credit Suisse Financial Products

I would be happy to come up and retrieve them as soon as you have them ready.
If you have any questions, please give me ( 3-0443) or Joe ( 3-3316) a call.

Thanks - we're looking forward to being able to implement this procedure.

ENA signed two originals of the Letter Agreement (as the Letter Agreement
has only two parties).  I kept one for ENA and provided the other to Greg
Lang for PPL by letter dated May 2, 2001.  I still do not have an original
of PPL's signature, but Greg Lang did provide a fax copy.    Is it necessary
for the parties to sign additional copies for non-parties?   I am checking
with ENA on the GE documents.  Thanks.

The lenders have specifically asked for an original of the Letter Agreement.
If it is really problematic to get another 2 copies signed, I can ask them
again if they will accept a copy.  I appreciate that there are only 2
parties to the document, but the lenders' reasoning is that the Letter
Agreement is a key underlying document and as such, they would expect to
have an original.  Also, our original arrangement was that we would sign 6
originals of each relevant document so that all parties could have
originals.

I know what a pain it is to get documents re-executed and I apologize that
this request has come so late in the day.

Regards
Isabel

1,"As a follow up to my email from yesterday, responses to SoCalEd's Petition 
are due on Tuesday, January 2.  Dan Watkiss has spoken to the FERC attorneys 
who will be answering the Petition, and he is comfortable that FERC will be 
able to adequately defend FERC against the Petition.  Additionally, Sue Mara 
will contact IEP to see if they will be responding to the Petition, and I 
have a call in to EPSA to see if they will be responding.  Therefore, because 
the responses seem to be adequately covered, and to keep Enron's name out of 
the headlines, we do not plan on responding separately to the Petition.

If you have any comments or questions, please let us know.

		 Subject: SoCalEd Petition for a Writ of Mandamus

On December 26, SoCalEd filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus against FERC 
regarding FERC's December 15 order, asking the Court of Appeals for the D.C. 
Circuit to direct FERC to establish and order ""just and reasonable cost-based 
rates"" for sales in the California ISO and PX markets.  SoCal requests that 
the Court act by January 5.

SoCal argues that its lenders have said that unless FERC acts immediately to 
""restore creditor confidence"" in SoCal's ability to repay its loans, that 
SoCal will not be able to access additional funding, so that by mid-January 
SoCal will be unable to buy electricity, resulting in rolling blackouts to 
its customers.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like a faxed copy of 
the petition.

APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE

POSTED May 23, 2000

Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression 
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a 
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make 
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a 
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and 
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE 
compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.   
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental 
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental 
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the 
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it 
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing 
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure 
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other 
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression 
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights 
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more 
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for 
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed 
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should 
be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after 
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  
Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close 
after Noon on June 23, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value 
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on 
this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

1,"Elizabeth,

 Per your request, I have prepared the following summary.

Western RTO Development:

RTO West.
Area to be included -- WA, OR, ID, MT, Western WY, UT, NV-North & South and 
hopefully Canada (BC Hydro and possibly Alberta)
Filed with FERC ""Stage 1"" documents in October 2000 -- Governance, Bylaws, 
Draft of Operating Agreement, etc.
Stage 2 development begun January 2001 with of complete proposal in July 2001
Earliest practical operation Fall 2002 (optimistic based on quick on approval 
time)
Plan Quality -- Good overall 
Attractive Features -- independent board, single control area and real time 
voluntary energy market, all parties on same tariff, a tradeable transmission 
right with ""use or lose"" anti-hoarding provisions.
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to 
existing users for a ten year period (""use or lose"" will mitigate for short 
term rights but long term rights on existing system will be tough to get).
Desert STAR.
Area to be included -- AZ, NM, CO, Eastern WY
Governance established and Board has been organized.
Have not yet filed a complete plan 
Earliest practical operation Winter 2002 or beyond, depending on when they 
actually file their proposal
Plan quality --  Potentially promising
Attractive Features -- similar transmission right regime as RTO West
Unknown -- whether they will have a single control area, whether 
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to 
existing users, board selection committee was manipulated by publics (however 
in practice the independent board selected seems to have been little affected 
by the search firm nomination process)
CA-ISO.
Area included -- CA IOU's only
Fully operational but with CA/FERC jurisdictional struggle over Board 
appointment and independence.
Modifications to meet Order 2000 have been filed which appear to move 
transmission rights close to the proposals under discussion in RTO West and 
Desert STAR


Cooperative Regional Organization Activity:

Seams.
A joint task force of parties involved in RTO West, Desert STAR and CA-ISO 
began meeting in November 2000
Three major seams issues identified and work begun
Scheduling time lines -- aligning processes between three RTOs so that 
business across seams boundaries is not hampered for administrative reasons.
Nature of transmission rights and effect on loop flow -- making the 
congestion management systems work between the three RTOs.
Export fees -- goal is to eliminate pancaking of fixed cost charges between 
RTOs, perhaps by annual transfer payments between RTOs or some other 
reciprocity agreement.
RTG Consolidation.  
WRTA. SWRTA and WSCC voted to merge in to a single organization, the WIO 
(Western Interconnection Organization)
WIO will have three committee:   Planning, Operations, Market Interface.  
The Northwest organization (NRTA) has decided to stay independent for now, 
but if RTO West forms it may just disappear as a separate organization. 

If you need more detail, please let me know.

Steve Kean will be testifying at the Senate Energy Committee's hearing on 
Wednesday regarding California.  Steve and Jim Steffes asked me to contact 
you for the following information.  I've listed specific requests for several 
people, but am copying many more of you for your input as well.  Anything you 
can provide by sometime on Monday will be appreciated!

Dave Parquet - Siting of new power plants in California.  Any insight you can 
provide regarding the rules, the current climate, what would fix the current 
situation, etc.

Richard Sanders - Steve thinks he might be asked about whether the market was 
manipulated.  Please provide information on whether this was the case and who 
the participants likely were.  What's the current climate regarding 
sanctions, etc.?

Mary Schoen - Any information you can provide relating to air emission issues 
in California, and specific details for our recommendations regarding air 
emissions.

Steve Walton - The status on RTO West, Desert Star, Cal ISO and general 
information on RO development.   

Sue Mara - Specific ordering language requiring the utilities to buy only 
from the PX.  Was it required through legislation or the CPUC, and what 
exactly does it mean.  Who was involved in formulating the language?  
Information on block forward markets.

Alan Comnes - A copy of the CDWR response and anything they might have 
available regarding long term proposals from the government.

Dan Allegretti - We have the e-mail Jim sent regarding the UI deal.  Please 
provide more specifics on the deal, and information regarding portfolio 
management approach.

Thanks for your help!

First off I hope your still not at work when I send this.

Secondly it would be cool to meet earlier in the week but I'm in San Antonio
and will be until Friday.  I will be driving to Houston on Friday morning to
do some packing and then the parents will be coming up on Saturday morning
to help with the final move.  I will pretty much leave it in your ball park
about Friday night.  I know you have been working long hours and Friday is
just a bad day.  Even though I would like to see you, if you have a repeat
of last week then I understand if you want to call it off.  In that case
maybe we can meet up some other time.  Although I do remember a girl telling
me once that weekends are her time and she was going to go out no matter
what.

Let me know what you think and I'll probably give you a call Friday
afternoon to see how things are going.

Kyle

Subject: RE: Open items for MDEA

The value in the table is the beginning balance for each month.  So if they 
cancel in the middle of the month, they should pay the balance at the 
beginning of that month and no prorated minimum monthly fee.  If you prorate 
it on both ends, you end up getting the total balance shown at the beginning 
of the month.

What is the status of the Yazoo City master gas agreement?  Do we still want

Subject: Open items for MDEA

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Dr. Kaminski,
thanks for your mail.

I am sorry that I'll not be available earlier,
I will talk with my advisor, but
probably it will be pretty negative.
however, I may be able to start it from June1,
depending on what he tells..
We will meet tomorrow afternoon,
so I'll be able to let you know
whether we can start work earlier then.

And could you tell me briefly
what are those projects you have in mind?

Thanks!

1,"FYI.  The email below changes things for years 4 & 5 because we would need to 
have gas for the summer months.

Charlie - please proceed with getting the pricing as we talked about, but 
also try to get pricing for more of a firm service (instead of best efforts) 
for Summer '05 and '06.  What is the gas availability outlook for this time 
period?

Thanks.

Nick:

I wanted to check with you on one issue on the Midway pricing request 
currently at the desk.

The interruptible provision should be for the following profile:

 Years 1, 2, & 3 1,000 hours per year
 Years 4 &5 500 hours per year

This is the profile of allowed oil back-up operation under the project's air 
permit.

Is this profile consistent with the pricing request we discussed with Charlie 
yesterday afternoon?

Let me know.  I wanted to check this before they give us pricing back.

executed by Arthur Andersen and led by Kate Agnew.

We will schedule an opening meeting with you the week of May 7, 2001 to

controls exercised over activities are adequate and operating effectively.  

Results of the audit will be discussed with you and other appropriate 
personnel both during the audit and at the audit closing meeting. 

We will endeavor to conduct this audit in a manner that will minimize 
interruption of your normal business activities and we look forward to 
working with you and your personnel. Please call me at x5-4554 if have any

2,"Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple 
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, 
maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan 
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to 
keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the 
left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  That 
might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch 
would 
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and 
have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my 
alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed 
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan 
allowed.

1,"No one has ever mistaken me for being a shy or timid person...least of all 
Ted.  Therefore, telling him about the shirt was right in character for me.  
I think a part of him probably felt a little ashamed that a 23 yr. old girl 
with almost no dating experience could handle the situation with more class 
than him.  Anyway, there were a few other things established and solidified 
last night by Ted - 1. By his own admission, I am definitely smarted than him 
(while in the past I have challenged that I had to agree last night) 2. I am 
a confident, probably too much so, and well-adjusted individual.  Merely 
taking into account those two points, Ted in his present ""condition"" could 
never be a match for me.  I would either always feel like I was carrying him 
or rolling over him.  I'm still absolutely floored by the fact I have now 
dated a divorcee.  Does Chuck think less of me for being duped?  I hope 
not...he really seemed like a good (to everyone that met him).

I think Mom, Dad and I are all going to fly over on the same flight 
(Singapore Airlines).  I found a great deal from San Francisco for around 
$580.  I of course will have to fly from Houston which ups the fare to $800, 
but it's still the best deal around.  I can't wait to see you guys.

Subject: the weirdo has shown his true colors finally, and not just by e mail


First of all sorry about the ""overjealous"" not
""overzealous"" in my last e mail--it was late.

Anyway, to the important stuff...I think that's the
problem with dating 30 something guys who aren't
married.  Either a divorce in the past or too many
other hang ups (and this guy looks like he fits into
both categories).  I know that everyone says that, but
in my observation it has been true.  So you're stuck
between a rock and a hard place.  You want the
maturity level of someone like him, but sometimes
those older men are too much of a headache.  I'm glad
you at least got to say your toughts.  I can't believe
you told him about the t-shirt!  Oh well, what did you
have to lose by getting it all out there.  I'm glad
your questions are answered now.  I guess there really
wasn't anything he could say to fix things between you
guys!  I guess you'll just have to keep going to Steak
Night.

Subject: The CODE



The CODE (rules for men): 

1. Thou shall not rent 'Chocolat'. 

2. Under no circumstances may 2 men share an umbrella. 

3. Any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and
eaten by his fellow partygoers. 

4. When you are queried by a buddy's wife, girlfriend, mother, father,
priest, shrink, dentist, accountant, or dog walker, you need not and should
not provide any useful information whatsoever as to his whereabouts. You are

permitted to deny his very existence. 
 
5. Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a
friend out of jail within 12 hours. 

6. You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent without
recrimination; beyond that, anyone within 
earshot is allowed to call bullshit. (Exception:  When trying to pick up a
girl, the allowable exaggeration rate rises to 400 percent) 

7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off-limits
forever. 

8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for another guy who's running
late is 5 minutes. For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every
point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale. 

9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's refrigerator is
forbidden. You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable. 

10. No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another man. (In
fact, even remembering a friend's birthday is strictly optional.) 

11. Agreeing to distract the ugly friend of a hot babe your buddy is trying
to hook up with is your legal duty.  Should you get carried away with your
good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is forbidden to
speak of it, even at your bachelor party. 

12. Before dating a buddy's ex, you are required to ask his permission; and
he, in return, is required to grant it. 

13. Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated as spies
until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a
buffalo wing clean. 

14. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem  - you didn't see nothin'.


15. The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer. 

16. A man must never own a cat or like his girlfriend's cat.  

17. You girlfriend must bond with your buddy's girlfriends within 30 minutes
of meeting them. You are not required to make nice with her gal pals'
significant dick-heads --- low-level sports bonding is all the law requires.


18. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sports event, you may always
ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing. 

19. When your girlfriend / wife expresses a desire to fix her whiney friend
with your pal, you may give her the go-ahead only if you'll be able to warn
your buddy and give him time prepare excuses about joining the priesthood. 

20. (Gas Warfare Act) you may flatuate in front of a woman only after you've
brought her to climax. But, if you trap her head under the covers for the
purpose of flatuent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend. 

21. It is permissible to consume a fruity chick drink only when you're
sunning on a tropical beach...And it's delivered by a topless
supermodel...and it's free. 

22. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked. 
 
23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain
sober enough to fight. 
 
24. If a buddy is outnumbered, outmanned, or too drunk to fight, you must
jump into the fight. Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions have
caused you to think, ""What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin,"" you may
sit back and enjoy. 

25. Friends don't let friends wear Speedo's. Ever.  Issue closed. 

26. Phrases that may NOT be uttered to another man while weight lifting:
""Yeah, baby, push it!"" ""C'mon, give me one more! Harder!""  ""Another set and
we can hit the showers."" ""Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?"" 

27. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza,
but not both.  That's just plain mean. 

28. If you compliment a guy on his six-pack, you better be referring to his
beer. 

29. Never join your girlfriend / wife in dissings a buddy, except when she's
withholding sex pending your response. 

30. Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal footing: Both
urinating or both waiting in line. In all other situations, a nod is all the
conversation you need. 
 
31. If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, you may not
join him  ...too gay. 

32. Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt
one intervention. If he is able to get on his feet, look you in the eye, and
deliver a ""F@CK OFF!"" You are absolved of your of responsibility. 

33. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly ""just a friend"" have
carnal, drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is
no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big
mistake it was. 

34. In Black Jack, always split aces and eight's.  No arguments.

Weather an early test for fee caps: Any severe jump in prices will likely b=

curbed, experts say.
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 20, 2001)=20
California electricity prices have shot back up recently, potentially posin=
g=20
an early test of a new federal price-control plan that takes effect today.=
=20
Warm weather has sent wholesale prices doubling this week, partially=20
reversing a dramatic slide that had some state officials believing they'd=
=20
tamed the wildly unpredictable California electricity market.=20
The rebound in prices ""would be expected,"" said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of=
=20
the California Energy Markets newsletter. ""It's 110 degrees in Phoenix, and=
=20
it's 100 degrees (in Sacramento) and points in between.""=20
Prices this week moved back above $100 a megawatt hour, about double what=
=20
they were last week -- although well below the roughly $300 suppliers were=
=20
charging California in mid-May. Prices showed signs of stabilizing Tuesday,=
=20
analysts said.=20
Experts said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new price-mitigatio=
n=20
plan is likely to curb the most severe price spikes. ""This will eliminate t=
he=20
astronomical prices,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University o=
f=20
California Energy Institute.=20
But the plan probably won't bring California a cascade of cheap power,=20
either.=20
Prices likely will bump up constantly against FERC's new price caps, which=
=20
will fluctuate from time to time, and they're not likely to go much below t=
he=20
caps unless there's a significant glut of energy, said Peter Stiffler of th=
e=20
energy consulting firm Economic Insight Inc.=20
""Traders will always trade in at the price ceiling,"" Stiffler said. ""They'r=
e=20
going to offer power at the highest price they can.""=20
The fluctuating FERC caps are tied to the production costs of the=20
least-efficient, most-expensive generating plant operating in California wh=
en=20
supplies are tight and an official ""power alert"" is declared by the state's=
=20
Independent System Operator, which runs most of the power grid. When there=
=20
isn't a power alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the price establishe=
d=20
during the most recent alert.=20
FERC said the system would begin today with a cap of $108.49 a megawatt hou=
r=20
but would rise to $127.64 if a power alert is declared.=20
But the cap can fluctuate significantly. Under the old FERC plan, the price=
=20
cap in May was set at $267 a megawatt hour. The old plan was similar to the=
=20
new system but applied only to California and only kicked in during power=
=20
alerts.=20
With the caps flexible, generators could have incentives to withhold power =
at=20
some plants in order to raise the caps, said Stanford University economist=
=20
Frank Wolak.=20
The FERC plan ""still doesn't solve the problem of withholding,"" said Wolak,=
=20
chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee.=20
Wolak also said he's afraid FERC will let power generators exaggerate their=
=20
costs in order to bump up the caps.=20
""The good news is, they seem to be more serious,"" Wolak said of the=20
oft-criticized commissioners. ""But given how many times we've been taken in=
,=20
I'm wary.""=20
In addition, generators will be allowed to exceed the price caps if they ca=
n=20
justify it to FERC officials. Borenstein said FERC in the past has allowed=
=20
generators to justify just about every price level imaginable, and he's=20
suspicious that the commission will let generators do the same in order to=
=20
evade the new price controls.=20
State officials, while cautiously optimistic about the plan, were upset tha=
t=20
FERC will allow a 10 percent price premium on electricity because of the ri=
sk=20
of selling to the California market.=20
""We recognize that the risk of nonpayment in California continues to be=20
greater"" than in other states, the commission said in its written opinion,=
=20
released late Tuesday.=20
Gov. Gray Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the premium ludicrous=20
because the state Department of Water Resources has been buying electricity=
=20
ever since the state's troubled utilities exhausted their credit in=20
mid-January.=20
""The state is as creditworthy a buyer as you can get,"" Maviglio said.=20
Experts said the plan also won't correct the state's energy imbalance.=20
""None of this is going to have much effect on blackouts,"" Borenstein said.=
=20
""This is solving part of the problem; I'm worried people will think=20
everything has been solved.=20
""The emphasis now has to be on getting California to conserve,"" he added.=
=20
A spokesman for power generators, Gary Ackerman, said the price controls=20
could worsen shortages this summer and will discourage generating firms fro=
m=20
investing in the new power plants the West desperately needs.=20
Builders ""are going to sit on the fence and think about this,"" said Ackerma=
n,=20
head of the Western Power Trading Forum.=20
Acting in the face of mounting political pressure and unrelenting criticism=
=20
from California, FERC voted Monday to impose round-the-clock price controls=
=20
throughout the 11-state Western region.=20
The FERC plan replaces a three-week-old plan that applied only to Californi=
a=20
and took effect only when power reserves fell to below 7 percent of demand=
=20
and an official ""power alert"" was declared.=20
By extending the plan to the entire West, experts said the commission=20
probably put an end to the phenomenon known as ""megawatt laundering,"" in=20
which power was shipped out of California and then re-imported. Imported=20
power wasn't subject to the old price controls.=20
The new controls, said consultant Stiffler, ""significantly narrow the abili=

of a trader to move power around and play the market.""=20

State to borrow up to $5 billion to buy energy=20
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 20, 2001)=20
State Treasurer Phil Angelides announced Tuesday that he will borrow up to =
$5=20
billion to pay for future power purchases, a move he said was necessary to=
=20
avoid a continued drain on California's budget and cuts in other state=20
programs.=20
Since mid-January, energy purchased by the state Department of Water=20
Resources on the spot market and under long-term contracts has come out of=
=20
the state's general fund, the source of most state spending.=20
Once the loan becomes final by the end of next week, however, energy will b=
e=20
purchased with the proceeds.=20
Made possible by an emergency order from the governor, the loan ultimately=
=20
will be paid off by customers of the state's investor-owned utilities throu=
gh=20
their electricity rates.=20
""In essence, it stops the general fund bleeding,"" Angelides said.=20
The state has so far committed $8.2 billion from the general fund to=20
electricity purchases. Of that amount, Angelides said the Department of Wat=
er=20
Resources has actually spent about $6.1 billion through June 12 on power=20
purchases, and has received about $900 million back from customers'=20
electricity rates.=20
Officials expect the loan to finance power purchases through September, whe=
n=20
they plan to issue up to $13.4 billion in revenue bonds.=20
The bonds will reimburse the general fund and and pay off the loan.=20
""This gives the state some more running room, some more cushion in case=20
anything goes awry with the bond sale to make sure ... the state does not r=
un=20
out of general fund money, jeopardizing education programs, law enforcement=
=20
programs, children's and health services,"" the Democratic treasurer said.=
=20
Angelides said he has obtained firm commitments for $3.5 billion from JP=20
Morgan and Lehman Brothers at a blended interest rate of about 4.5 percent.=
=20
If the long-term bonds are not issued by Oct. 31, the interest rate would=
=20
climb to about 7 percent.=20
Lawmakers initially had hoped to close the short-term loan in May and float=
=20
the long-term bonds shortly thereafter. However, Republicans in the state=
=20
Legislature balked at the plan, forcing the delay of the bond sale until=20
mid-August.=20
Rather than wait, Gov. Gray Davis invoked his emergency powers to allow for=
=20
the loan and circumvent the delay.=20
Assembly Republicans don't mind that the governor used his emergency powers=
=20
to expedite the loan, said James Fisfis, a spokesman for the caucus. Instea=
d,=20
he said, they're concerned the loan could backfire and hurt Californians.=
=20
""If the larger bond offering falls through, the penalties and added interes=
t=20
could add up on ratepayers' bills,"" he said.=20
But Angelides argued that the loan would benefit ratepayers on several=20
fronts: Power generators can no longer argue the state should pay a ""credit=
=20
premium"" on electricity, he said, and for the most part will not be able to=
=20

Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers,But Still Trading
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. 
""It's not getting any better,"" said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. 
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. 
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. 
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. 
""They've been cut off from so many people,"" said one electricity trader. 
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions 

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. 
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. 
""We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility,"" Thode said. 
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. 
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. 
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating ""evolving."" Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.

HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp. over their proposed merger, as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some 40 percent. 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal,"" Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters. He declined to give further details.
Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is currently in a ""due diligence"" examination of Enron's complex financial books that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday. 
The buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about $10.41 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to near $4, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all. 
The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of 0.2685 of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to around 0.15 instead, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Enron is willing to accept the lower valuation, given the pressure on its stock price, the sources said. 
Enron's shares bounced on Dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks, trading up 22 cents at $4.23 in late afternoon action on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had dipped as low as $3.84 in late-morning dealings and as high $4.49. Dynegy's shares gained 4.7 percent or $1.83 to move to $41.08 on the NYSE. 
Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt past the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002. The sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $500 million in cash, which Enron has said it was seeking. 
There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which would be Dynegy's consolation prize if the deal fell apart, a source said. Published reports have said that investment banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans, and may dispute Dynegy's ownership if the deal breaks up. 
""The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized. There's a solid earnings stream from that thing,"" said one source familiar with the discussions. 
ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN 
Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off. Enron was not immediately available for comment. 
Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyout, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise. Enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactions with North America's largest energy trader because of credit concerns. 
""This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the principal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less then Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business,"" said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade. 
But as Enron's stock continued to lose value, down over 50 percent since Dynegy's initial bid, it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well. Enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $3 billion, from $60 billion at the start of 2001. (additional reporting by Jeff Goldfarb, Janet McGurty and Jonathan Stempel in New York).

Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky. 
Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.
Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion. 
The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said. 
As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion. 
Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer. 
But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way. 
Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy. 
Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
""There's nothing like accounting to scare people,"" said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron.

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price

11/27/2001

(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said. 
At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.
The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98. 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks. 
Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd. 
As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised. 
The current agreement with Dynegy contains a ""material adverse change"" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
""Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is,"" said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co. 
Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse. 
""The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars,"" said Gheit. 
If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd.

IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms
By Carol S. Remond

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.
And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader. 
Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal. 
""We're trying to figure out a good play,"" said a trader at a New York hedge fund. 
So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds. 
""People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it,"" a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, ""We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides."" 
Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price. 
Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. ""Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds,"" said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds. 
Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share. 
Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds. 
When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount. 
Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15. 
""A lot of the guys are still very skeptical,"" said a bond trader at a New York bank. ""But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds."" 
Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position. 
""We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive,"" the manager of a large New York hedge fund said.

Dynegy Confirms Talks On Enron Deal Structure - Source
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enron Corp. (ENE). 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal,"" said John Sousa. ""I can't elaborate any further at this time.""
An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment. 

Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report. 
Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%. 
Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share. 
The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion. 
While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent. 
Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron ""locked down"" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses. 
Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said. 
If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from ""pending""' or ""threatened"" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked. 
In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron.

The discussions between Enron and Dynegy aren't merely focused on revising the consideration Dynegy will pay. They are also aimed at providing Enron with additional funding and at restructuring its debt, said a person familiar with the negotiations. 
The moves are aimed at restoring confidence in Enron and relieving ""the perceived liquidity crisis,"" the source said.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says
2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's
Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action
today on the largest energy trading company.

     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings
communication, said although there was speculation in the market
that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take
any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.

     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's
credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the
energy trader in private equity.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.



Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle
2001-11-27 15:16 (New York)

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,
seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have
been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,
the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.

     ``I was approached by several people to invest in the
company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor
from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined
95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good
investment, he said.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.

     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,
jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its
stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks
between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction
convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take
place.

     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed
yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about
55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5
percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The
stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.

                        Declining to Invest

     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan
to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion
package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,
which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more
than two weeks.

     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that
invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle
Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people
familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to
comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We
are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''

   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,
which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong
American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her
portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.

     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy
is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of
Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less
than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the discussions.

                               Terms

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS
Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings
to 75 cents a share from $1.65.

     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of
payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in
cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit
rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

                           Cash Question

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right
now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not?''

     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due
this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from
lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million
credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he
was ``encouraged'' by the developments.



Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)


     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at
Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he
helps manage at Liberty.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday.

     ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy
deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just
waiting.''

     ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be
implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't
walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were
to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to
resuscitate Enron back to health.''



A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)


     St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and
doesn't own shares of either company.

     The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a
renegotiated bid, Heim said.

     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim
said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up
of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the
deal to have real value.''

Subject: Gorons

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-


What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a ""cushy""  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to ""invent the
Internet"" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, ""Love Story"" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton ""one of
the greatest Presidents of our history.""

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and
that of the USA.

   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to
aid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to
your normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

1,"A heads up for you gas folks that Enron will be on ComEd's side against Dynegy on this power issue at 
FERC, since EES designates Firm LD contracts as sources on ComEd's network transmission system (Dynegy wants ComEd to only allow ""capacity"" contracts to be used).  We plan to file the Enron response on Friday.

Subject:	Dynegy v. ComEd update

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Message below from Professor Levine regarding E201B:

Dear Macro class,

This message concerns the first macroeconomics class, which will be held next
week October 21, 22 in C210.  Please read in the textbook ""The Science of
Macroeconomics"" and ""The Data of Macroeconomics,"" Mankiw Chapters 1 and 2.

You should start receiving the Financial Times a few days before class begins.
If you do not receive your first copy before class begins, please contact 
Shawn

Homework zero.  Please do before first class, but do not hand in:

1.      List three ways in which GDP over- or understates a nation's typical
standard of living.
2.      List 2 reasons why the CPI might over- or understate the true 
inflation
rate.
3.      What are 3 reasons why it matters if the CPI is accurate?
4.      Please look in the Financial Times and find a story that fits your
name.
        A) If your first name begins with A-D, find a story concerning why
living standards and output per capita differ so much between one or more
richer and poorer countries.
        B) If your first name begins with E-K, find a story concerning
persistently high or low unemployment and inflation.
        C) If your first name begins with L-O, find a story concerning

Further to my message of yesterday evening, I have spoken with the MSCS 
lawyer in London and learned that EnronCredit.com Limited (""ECCL"") has 
finalized its ISDA Master Agreement and CSA with MSCS.  ECCL is awaiting the 
ENE guaranty.  The lawyer is forwarding docs to me this morning and I 
understand they were heavily negotiated.

 Tanya, will you be handling credit for both ENA and ENE?  I would like to 
chat with whomever is handling today, if possible.  I will forward ECCL to 
you both when I receive.

Thanks.  Sara

1,"As you probably know, Rogers (in the East) and Don (in the West) will be working directly with the wholesale desk.   Tim and I will ensure a fair balance is achieved between retail and wholesale.

As an Enron shareholder, I fully appreciate that we need explosive growth and profitability out of EES, particularly with reduced volatility in gas and power markets over the next several years.

I am commited to ensuring that the retail risk management organization is offered all the tools, information, systems, competitive pricing, etc. to allow EES to offer fully bundled competitively priced products to retail customers.

I look forward to working with you and Dave in continuing to grow this business."

UPDATE 1-Western lawmakers want Bush help with power

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - Thirty-three Democratic U.S. lawmakers from 
California, Washington state and Oregon wrote to Energy Secretary Spencer 
Abraham on Monday demanding stronger federal action to help western states 
suffering from an ongoing electricity shortage crisis.

The lawmakers want a regionwide price cap for wholesale power prices to 
prevent hugely inflated prices and rolling blackouts this summer when demand 
intensifies due to air conditioning season.

They specifically criticized the Republican-led Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) for failing to maintain fair and reasonable rates, allowing 
generators to profit from power prices some 10 times historical levels.

""If political leadership were exercised today by the administration and FERC, 
California and the Pacific Northwest would already be on their way to ending 
the price-gouging,"" said Rep. Anna Eshoo, a Democrat from California.

FERC last week approved a number of price mitigation measures to tame the 
power shortages in California, but remains against a regional price cap.

The stance has drawn the ire of many lawmakers and dissent from FERC 
Commissioner William Massey, who says without such caps, the situation will 
not get better. Massey is outflanked on the commission by FERC Chairman 
Curtis Hebert, a Republican, and Linda Breathitt, a Democrat.

Experts in California estimate power supplies could fall some 5,000 megawatts 
short this summer on a daily basis, threatening the return of rolling 
blackouts to cut demand.

Eshoo is also the author of legislation to impose cost-of-service based rates 
in the Western energy market.

2,"John,

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

"
2,"Steve, I had some time this afternoon, so I have called the executive 
assistants myself.  Most have some sort of org charts (see ENA below), but 
many have only business unit ""executive committee"" charts and do not go 
further in the organization.  I'll forward to you what I've received (several 
e-mails will follow).  Once you've had a chance to look at them, let me know 
what you think.  SRS

Subject: Re: VEPCO/FYI  

Thanks.  I think we have alot of the same accounting issues here if the PPA 
is construed to be a lease.  If it is a lease, we have similar spending and 
EPC concerns as our other deals.  Do we know who the O&M contractor will be?  
If ENA or affiliate, we should not take on plant risk - just make sure our 
fair value O&M fee is the only amount at risk under the O&M agreement.  As of 
Friday, AA told us that even in a non-offtake situation, they may say we are 
in a lease if we take on plant risk through an O&M agreement.  This was new 
news to us.

Subject: VEPCO/FYI

I'm working with the commerial team on on PPA (and associated transactions) 
for Virginia Power.  The project involves the construction of  a peaker to 
supply some/most of the power, with the ability to supply from the market as 
well.  The plant has an 01 service date, so things are really picking up. 

Matt and Herman, this is the transaction we discussed with Heather a few 
weeks ago.

Items on the immediate to do list include:

Executing a land option agreement
Closing on the land (or assign to City of Rocky Mount, and let them close)
Selling/transferring the land to the City of Rocky Mount; negotiate long term 
lease
Negotiating a PILOT agreement (payment in lieu of taxes) with the City
Negotiating fuel supply agreements
Selecting/contracting with EPC contractor - can it be NEPCO?
Long lead equipment purchases (?) - could be home for LM 6000's, but other 
equipment may be needed
Negotiate interconnection agreement

This deal is showing a lot of life, so I thought it might be helpful to give 
you a heads up.

"
2,"Greg - looks good to me on the legal procedures.  My only comments would be 
(i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought 
they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the 
commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter, even when it's an unusual 
matter.  I agree about Tana.

Subject: Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process

Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor, I wanted to confirm our collective 
understanding/proposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the 
financial trading process in Canada.  As you are all aware, all financial 
confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm 
desk in Calgary.  However, it seems that there has been some confusion 
relating to the legal procedures associated with this process.

In short, I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process 
regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for 
Canadian physical confirms.  That is, as is currently the process for 
physical deals, the Canadian confirm desk will generate all deal tickets and, 
to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward, will 
generate, have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation 
letters, with no involvement of the legal department.  However, for any 
financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms 
(as well as amendments), just as with physical transactions, the confirm desk 
will generate the deal ticket and provide it to Linda or Sharon in Calgary.  
Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the 
deal tickets, which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark 
Powell.  Once approved, the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing 
lawyer, checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review, 
approve and have executed.  The executed confirm will then be returned to 
either Linda or Sharon, who will attend to distributing it to the 
counterparty.  Again, this will only be required for transactions which are 
out of the ordinary.

With respect to negotiating and implementing, and addressing ongoing legal 
concerns with respect to, ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, Mark Taylor's 
group, and I understand specifically Mary Cook, will continue to have 
responsibility for such matters.  Therefore, to the extent that we need to 
put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal 
concerns about the implementation of the ISDA, the process will be the same 
as it has been in the past, meaning that those matters will be dealt with in 
Houston.

Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing 
initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations, I think it is essential 
that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run 
each of Sharon and Linda (as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggy's 
group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters) through her 
ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our 
legal group to deal with these matters.  As well, we will need to ensure that 
Linda and Sharon receive (either from Houston or Dianne) electronic versions 
of all confirmation precedents (ie. confirm forms, amendment forms, etc.) 
necessary for them to properly undertake these activities.

If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me.  Otherwise, I think we should implement these 
procedures as soon as possible, including having Tana join us for a few crisp 
winter days in Calgary.

Thanks

Greg

Good morning:

I have returned from an amazing ""vacation"" in Hawaii and it is good to be
home.  I played a ton of golf (thanks to my friend Pritch) and even rested
some.

I am playing in the Houston City Amateur this Friday, Saturday and Sunday at
Memorial Park.  To my Houston friends, please feel free to come out to the
park if your weekend schedule permits and you want a bit of sun and
exercise.  I'm first off tomorrw at 7:45am and Saturday, I tee off at
12:15pm.

This was one of the last places Meredith and I were together the day she
died.  My brother, Ford, is coming in from Austin to caddy for me for this
tournament as well as a qualifier for the USGA Mid-Am on Monday at
Shadowhawk.  It promises to be a special weekend for me and for us.

I continue to walk through the pain and loneliness.  Each day seems to bring
new challenges, but I press on.  I am shocked and saddened by the events on
the east coast just like everyone, but we will be a stronger and more
compassionate nation going forward.  A most unfortunate event, I know there
are so many, many families now who can partially identify with my loss.

God bless you all.  I look forward to visiting with everyone in the coming
weeks and months.

Love,

Tim

To get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet).  Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows.  She is completely independent from the hotel and I'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has.  They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket.  It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see.  I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now.  You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead.  Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town.
 
Rent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first .
 
I agree with John, your best hotel bet is the Marriott Marquis, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best.
 
Don't forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast!
 
Keep us posted.  
 
Kim.

Gosh, that sounds great!
 
It's been more than 5 years since we've been to NYC, but here's what I'd do...this weekend, look around BR (that's Baton Rouge) for the Sunday issue of the New York Times.  Look in the Lifestyle section (or the NYT equivalent) and you'll undoubtedly see ads for weekend specials and/or package deals to the city, possibly including airfare, hotel, theater tickets, meals, airport transfers, etc.
 
Other than that, you can check out the Marriott Marquis Hotel, which has its own theater and may offer special weekend rates.  Don't gasp when you find out that a room is going to run you $200/night ++, that's just the going rate for a very expensive city.
 
You'll need to visit the TKTS booth in Times Square, where folks queue up mid-morning for half-priced same-day tickets to some great shows...and some real dogs.  You won't find any Producers tickets there, unfortunately, but Rent may be available.  See Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables, for sure.
 
Grab lunch at the Carnegie Deli, but don't fall on the floor when you order the $18 reuben sandwich.  Pay the $3 split fee and share it with Teri.  Note the huge desserts and the terse wait staff.
 
See if the Rainbow Room is still open for dinner and dancing.  Kim and I celebrated our 10th anniversary there with Mike & Cheryl Pope (it was Cheryl's 40th BD, too).  The Rainbow Room is in Rockefeller Center (where NBC is located).
 
Everything is going to be expensive, so get used to it.
 
Let me know what you decide!
 
BTW, how's Poppy?  Mom said he's made an amazing comeback from the brink...

Bro:
 
I am thinking of suprosing Teri for our 20th anniversary.  I would like to take her for a quick trip to NYC.  I would really like to get tickets to The Producers but it appears to be sold out until March, 2001.
 
If we make the trip, in what part of town do you suggest we stay?  What hotel has reasonable prices?  We  would like to go to a play.  Other than that, I have absolutely no ideas.  Any ideas as to which play we can get tickets to at this late date?  Rent is still available and I've heard good things about it.
 
I would appreciate any help you can lend.

Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would 
like more information 

(Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect 
confidentiality  - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential 
right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we 
don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties)



*EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against 
TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  Judge Edgar 
has been assigned the matter.

*The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA 
entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA).

*The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of 
TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to 
schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at 
the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at 
the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.  EPMI believes 
that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue.  

*A trial date in late June 2000 has been set.

*EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.

Subject: Letter of Intent


	


Gentlemen,

I have received a fax confirmation of Mr. Bruciak's execution of the 
Confidentiality Agreement this afternoon.  Thank you.

Attached is a draft Letter of Intent (""LOI"") pertaining to our discussions 
about the feasibility and development of an approximate 500 MW power station 
sited at or near the Port of Brownsville.  The LOI is structured similarly to 
the existing Participation Agreement, wherein BPUB and ENA exclusively 
collaborate to investigate the feasibility of the power station and secure a 
suitable site, if justified.  It is proposed that ENA cover the costs of the 
development effort, including permitting and site acquisition, with such 
costs being eventually treated as either Project construction costs or 
operating costs, depending upon the nature of the expense.  I have also 
proposed that ENA pay BPUP a $10,000 Consulting Fee to cover any outside 
expenses associated with the drafting and execution of this agreement and the 
site option agreement(s).  The proposed term of the LOI expires 31 December 
2001, unless either of us determines earlier that the joint effort will not 
be successful.  During the term of the LOI, it is proposed that BPUB and ENA 
will determine and agree upon an appropriate Project equity participation and 
finance structure.

Something we may want to consider is the transfer of BPUB's equity in the 
Oklaunion plant in exchange for equity in the new Cameron County plant.  This 
would be especially appealing if BPUB's interest in Oklaunion also included 
switching rights through the nearby DC Tie and if there are additional 
Oklaunion interests available with DC Tie switching rights.  

Please let know a convenient time when we talk through the proposed LOI and 
address any of your questions.

1. Introduction

Rotation abounds on the Big Chart as some of the formerly
weak groups are showing some signs of life, while some of
the stronger groups are starting to see their high
percentile rankings slip.  Speculation about lower interest
rates, a growing consensus that the Nasdaq has established
a bottom, and seasonal factors are all spurring the
reallocation of investment dollars.

____________________________________________________________

2. Groups that are Heating Up

This week's analysis starts right at the top of the Big
Chart with the banking sector.  All three industry groups
within the sector - Banks {.BAN}, Banks/Savings & Loan
{.BSL}, and Banks/Savings Banks {.BSB} - saw their
respective rankings rise last week.  The primary driver
behind this move was an improved interest rate outlook,
though Joe Morford at Dain Rauscher Wessels noted that
merger activity is picking up.  Among the best performers
were Century South {CSBI} (announced merger with BB&T
{BBT}), Charter One Financial {CF}, Imperial Bancorp {IMP}
(testing resistance), and Comerica {CMA}.

Selected groups within the electronics sector improved their
rankings.  Electronics/Motors rebounded back to the 85th
percentile after briefly dropping from green to yellow, two
weeks ago.  The group is being powered by electronics
conglomerate Emerson {EMR}, which set a new record high.
The Electronics/Semiconductors {.ESE} group seems to have
found a bottom, though it still remains among the worst
performing industry groups.  Nonetheless, it's worth noting
that the group's ranking has fallen below the tenth
percentile just twice since the beginning of October.
Electronics/Specialty instruments began its recovery after
posting a big drop on the Big Chart two weeks ago, with
gains by Zygo {ZIGO}, Newport Corporation {NEWP}, and
Trimble Navigation {TRMB}.

Other industry groups that gained ground last week include
Chemicals {.CHE}, Computer/Components {DCO},
Drugs/Biotechnology {.DBI}, Leisure/Race Tracks {.LRT},
Retail/Stores/Discount {.RDI}, and Retail/Stores/Specialty
{.RSP}, which improved its ranking for the fourth consecutive
week.

____________________________________________________________

3. Groups that are Cooling Off

Market sentiment finally coalesced with respect to the
entire utilities sector, and that sentiment was toward
profit taking.  Utilities/Diversified {.UDI} fell out of the
top quintile for the first time in five weeks and only the
second time since the beginning of October.  PG&E {PCG} fell
by more than 10 percent after the president of the California
Public Utilities Commission, Lorretta Lynch, said that
requests for electric rate increases by PCG and Southern
California Edison were premature.  Utilities/Gas/Producer-Gatherer
{.UPG} also dropped out of the top quintile, while
Utilities/Electric/Holding {.UHO} is threatening to turn from
green to yellow.

The beverage sector - which includes Beverages {.BEV},
Beverages/Beer & Ale {.BBA}, Beverages/Bottlers {.BBO},
Beverages/Distillers {.BDI}, Beverages/Soft Drink Syrup
{.BSD} - weakened as investors began funneling more money
into the tech sector.

Other groups that that fell on the Big Chart include
Energy/Oil-Gas/Domestic {.ODO}, Leisure/Casinos-Gaming {.LCG},
Vehicles/Truck-Trailers {.ATT}, and Homes/Hotels-Motels-Inns
{.HOT} - a group that we noted last week was likely to fall.

4. On the Radar Screen this Week

The retail sector could be worth watching over the next few
weeks as holiday shopping picks up.  Though many stores are
relying on discounts to draw in consumers, certain industry
groups within the sector have been improving their rankings;
these groups include Retail/Stores/Department {.RDE},
Retail/Stores/Discount {.RDI}, and the aforementioned
Retail/Stores/Specialty {.RSP}.  Stocks that are performing
well in these groups include Footstar {FTS}, Bebe Stores
{BEBE} and Target {TGT}.

____________________________________________________________

5. Stock In Focus

Foostar {FTS} has more than survived the volatility of the
past several weeks with a six-week gain of 32.0 percent. The
company saw same-store sales increase 13.5 percent in
November and could be on its way to posting a strong December;
particularly since FTS has a history of exceeding analyst
expectations by notable margins.  Footstar operates the
Footaction and Just for Feet chains and, last month, agreed
to acquire the footwear division of J. Baker {JBAK}.

Subject: Asset Financing - Structured Finance Presentation

We are planning a presentation on certain structure and contracting issues 
related to power plant asset financing on Thursday, May 10th.  The 
presentation will include lunch from Treebeard's and will begin at 11:30.  We 
have scheduled 2.5 hours for the presentation; it may be shorter, depending 
on the number of questions. 

We plan to include the Portland folks by video-conference.   If you know of 
others who would benefit from this presentation, please pass on this 
invitation; I have not intended to exclude anyone who may want to attend.  If 
there are others at remote locations, please let me or Dina Snow know so that 
we can arrange for video-conferencing.  John, I asked Shirley for the names 
of your contracts folks and have included them; I still have no information 
as to whom else you want to include.  Therefore, please forward this to your 
team members as you see fit.

Please RSVP to Dina Snow at X57099 or by e-mail to dina.snow@enron.com by 
Tuesday, May 8th.

We will e-mail the conference room location when it is confirmed.


Thanks,

Rose

2,"JOhn--I just had a chance to review his testimony and I just don't think we could ask for a better (and still be believable!) statement from a consumer advocate.  I was thinking that although this is testimony before COngress, it would also be good cover for FERC.  Do you or Sarah or Christi know if FERC does or can include Congressional testimony in their analysis or can they only use formal intervention type documents?  I was just thinking that whoever interacts with FERC in the DC office could make sure that they have a copy?

Below is a link to the prepared testimony of Michael Travieso, Maryland People's Counsel, at the Barton RTO hearing last week.  His comments on the importance of a fewer number of RTOs, each with a broad geographic scope, track our own views.  As with the CFA report by Mark Cooper several months ago, these consumer groups are important to showing third party support for our efforts, particularly among Democrats in Congress.

Each quarter I will evaluate the classes (mainly attendance) to see how well 
they are performing.  Then I will be able to make adjustments to the schedule 
accordingly.  Our goal is to get people to try new things and not just go 
back to what they did before.  We have spent a lot of time and money getting 
brand new weights, spinning bikes and cardio equipment in here and want you 
all to have a chance to try it out.  Just give this schedule a try for a 
while when we open and keep me posted with your feedback.  Thanks!

Ann, do you think if there is not as many people participating in the 
spinning classes at lunch, you would offer additional spinning classes in the 
evening?  I noticed there is a spinning class offered every day at lunch but 
only one class offered in the evening.   There  are numerous people who were 
hoping to enjoy spinning two times a week but due to our work environment we 
are only able to work out in the evenings, period.     In addition,  we were 
hoping to do Bootcamp the other two remaining evenings, which looks like 
right now it is only offered on Monday and previously it was offered both 
Monday and  Wednesday.   

Is it possible that  if you do not have very much participation for the 
""total body conditioning class""  on Tuesday & Thursday you could replace it 
with another spin class and another bootcamp class.    Or maybe the ""total 
body conditioning class"" could be moved to  Monday and Wednesday and then it 
would free up the studio to have Bootcamp on Tuesday & Thrusday.   Then if 
you hopefully add another spin class you could insert it on Monday so you 
would be offering an evening spin class both Monday and Wednesday.   That 
would be wonderful.    

Also do you think before the spin class (s) in the evening  an ""ab lab"" class 
could be added before the beginning of class like at 5:30 pm?   

Any feedback you have would be great.   For a lot of us who have to work-out 
in the evenings only we hoping to be able to at least do a spin class  
acouple of times and then a boot camp a couple of times.     If  there is 
enough particiaption for this do you know how long it will take to get set 
up?   

Thank you for all of you help, comments or suggestons.

1,"I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

Mike,

Can you join us on Wednesday morning, November 15 to play golf at Canyon 
Springs golf course in San Antonio prior to the Enron Management Conference? 
Canyon Springs will allow us to book a 10:00am tee time thirty days in 
advance. Once I have confirmed the tee time I will forward directions to the 
course. Should be a fun group. Might even need a practice round at Champions 
prior to the trip. 

Doug

"
2,"I sent over to Scot Chambers a one page summary of Rochester and the one page 
project eval form that always needs to be filled out before getting O&M 
numbers to Scot.  He knows that we need the numbers by Wednesday afternoon.  
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks
Ben"

Despite the personal pleasure that I would derive from seeing Glynn and Richard strike out big time, it's not worth the price to ratepayers of letting these pirates (yes, pirates!) rip off so many valuable assets that should stay under PUC regulation for the benefit of consumers.

Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1645&""><B>Priest Holmes</B></A>, RB KC - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=235069&""><B>Bill Gramatica</B></A>, K ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>According to the <I>Arizona Republic</I>, Gramatica will miss nine months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus cartilage in his right knee while celebrating a 42-yard field goal on Saturday against the New York Giants.

Seattle coach Mike Holmgren said that an MRI test revealed the injury. Holmgren said he will probably put Watters on injured reserve. Watters will decide whether to have an operation on his ankle or let it heal, Holmgren said. The injury puts Shaun Alexander back into the forefront at a crucial time of the year for most Fantasy players.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=187388&""><B>Bubba Franks</B></A>, TE GB - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/17/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>

Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12 carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries, but he?s a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.<BR>

Boston had eight catches for 84 yards on Saturday against the N.Y. Giants. Boston was held out of the end zone, but he's still one of the best Fantasy receivers in the game. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. <BR>

<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1196&""><B>Eric Moulds</B></A>, Active WR<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/14/01</FONT><BR>
Moulds has been an up-and-down player this year. He might have trouble getting open against Ty Law. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

Look for Dyson to be a solid No. 2 receiver this week. He might not score, but should catch a lot of passes. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

Hasselbeck may not do much against the Dallas defense. The Cowboys' defense has been solid against the pass, and Hasselbeck has been erratic in his first year as a starter.<BR>
</FONT><BR>

Brown should get in the end zone this week. The Bills will have trouble handling him in the open field. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

Ismail has been a solid receiver but could struggle this week against a tough Steelers defense. Consider benching him this week if you have another receiver with a better matchup. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=133448&""><B>Ricky Williams</B></A>, Active RB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/09/01</FONT><BR>
Williams was held to only 41 yards rushing on Sunday, but he did score his seventh touchdown of the year. Williams is a solid Fantasy tailback, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1599&""><B>Trent Green</B></A>, Active QB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/09/01</FONT><BR>
Green had a good outing against Oakland, posting 253 yards passing, two touchdowns and one interception. Green has thrown six more picks than touchdowns this season, however, so don?t depend on him too heavily during the Fantasy playoffs.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=187390&""><B>Thomas Jones</B></A>, Reserve RB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/07/01</FONT><BR>
Jones scored a touchdown last week against Oakland, but he's still not seeing enough carries to warrant Fantasy consideration. Unless you're desperate and in a deeper league, there's no reason to risk starting Jones in Week 13. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

Linebacker Derrick Brooks has reportedly ended his 10-day holdout. Brooks, who has been in a contract dispute with the Buccaneers, participated in practice on Wednesday. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=1680&key=1400&""><B>John Carney</B></A>, Active K<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 04/15/01</FONT><BR>
Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points. <BR>

Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain on the active roster until Sunday. ""I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals,"" Wilkins said. ""It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no tweaks."" <BR>

In case you have little time for it, I could write the answer for the 
technical corner for Monday. I have an intuitive explanation based on

Sara,
Sorry, I was too assiduous in deleting what I thought would be duplicated on 
this thread, so I'm working from memory on comments before Guenther's last 
contribution.

Data for pricing is owned by Enron Credit Ltd (generated by employees of 
Enron Power Operations Ltd whose costs are charged to ECL)
Information deals are done with ECL (Derivative transactions are currently 
with Enron North America Corp, probably with Enron Credit Inc in the future)
The Enron staff who would be looking at this are employed by Enron North 
America Corp which is why I suggested ENAC as the named party.
They clearly act for ECL on information deals.
If it's OK to use ECL then that would be easier for us.

I have no objections to suggestions that I should be promoted! In the 
meantime, I am a board director of ECL and have both legal and group 
management authority to sign contracts (with a lawyer's initials being a 
prerequisite).

Regards,
Richard

Thanks for the response.  I'll wait to hear from Richard Sage as to who owns 
the information.
Only officers at the VP level or higher may execute binding contracts for all 
Enron U.S. companies (bylaws).  I do not know the ""rule"" for non-U.S.

Sara

You are right about the tax issue - in fact, we are in the process of 
replacing the UK directors and officers of Enron Credit Inc with US directors 
and officers.

The entity that signs up to the confidentiality agreement ought to be the one 
that owns the information to be supplied.  Based on conversations I have had 
with Richard Sage, I had formed the impression that the owner of the 
information was Enron Credit Ltd.  If this is right, we should pursue your 
first suggestion.  Otherwise, given that the tax issue is being rectified and 
this should therefore be an isolated incident, I think we can wear the tax 
risk inherent in your second suggestion.  Though I do wonder whether an 
officer of Enron Credit Inc, such as Richard Sage (currently), could sign, 
rather than a director?

Kind regards

Guenther Klar

		 Subject: IMPORTANT CONFERENCE CALL ON QF/SRAC MATTERS SCHEDULED FOR 12:30 
P.M. (NOONISH) ON SUNDAY, JAN.  21

An important conference call is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, 
Today, Jan 21 to discuss the status of legislative meetings on QF/SRAC 
matters.  
 
Call-In number is            888-422-7124
Particpant Code is          111756
 
 
Status Report
After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF 
Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored ""deal"" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this 
morning.  The crux of the deal is as follows:
 
For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years [""all in"", i.e. includes 
capacity and energy]
1.0 on losses
no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity 
obligations in the past
Applies ""going forward"" (presumedly Feb. 1)
 
 
For gas-fired QFs...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;  payment will 
increase/decrease tied to gas  (this assumes an IER of 9821)
1.0 on line losses
applies ""going forward""
Caacity True-up and ""forbearance"" were not addressed.  Credit worthiness will 
be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).  
This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, 
followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.  This is 
essentially the PG&E/QF ""deal"" for the gas guys.  For the renewables, it is 
more of a fixed payment approach.
 
A ""Technical Conference"" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to 
work out some of the implementing details."
0,"El Paso announced changes to its pipeline cleaning and internal inspection 
program. Line 1100 between Eunice and Pecos River Stations will be smart 
pigged Sunday (postponed one day), causing a 200 MMcf/d flow reduction 
through Eunice to the South Mainline. Six interconnects will not be able to 
deliver into El Paso for 10 hours that day. Another smart pigging of Line 
1100 between Pecos River and Guadalupe Stations will occur Nov. 22 (also 
postponed one day), requiring a reduction of 200 MMcf/d through Pecos River. 
Line 1203 (Maricopa Line) pigging will be done Nov. 21-24, reducing the 
line's capacity by 60 MMcf/d and affecting deliveries of San Juan gas to the 
Phoenix area. Line 3222 pigging will be done Nov. 30 and Dec. 19, causing a 
100 MMcf/d allocation. Line 3201 pigging will be done Dec. 2 and 20, causing 
a 150 MMcf/d allocation. The allocations will affect points upstream of 
Bondad Mainline and Gallup. "
0,"FYI.  Appears that the Davis administration has thrown down the gauntlet, 
looking to position itself in a way that will allow it to blame the FERC/Bush 
administration for California's electricity crisis, unless FERC agrees to the 
ISO's price cap plan.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: FW: CAISO Notice - Draft Market Stabilization Plan


Greetings:
Late last night the ISO released a Market Stabilization plan that would
essentially impose cost based pricing control caps and apply a strict
California First Policy.

Here's ISO's 3-page sketch to impose cost-based pricing intended to control
costs on consumers on very short order.  Unit-specific cost-based bid caps
will apply to ISO markets.  ISO will have dispatch control over all CA
generation.  Capital costs and return appear to be excluded from the bid
caps.  ISO will pick of the day-ahead and day-of energy markets lot to the
demise of CalPX, thus ending the ""market separation.""  There appears to be
language that intimates direct unit dispatch, but the document is very thin
on this. ISO proposes payments based either on the ""as-bid"" up to unit bid
cap, or apparently a uniform market-clearing price based on marginal units
cap.  Out of state resources are paid California capped rates.  Settlement
will be on numbers other than those posted (so much for transparency).
There's looking to procure AS based on optimization, although this is not
spelled out well (it appears that self-provision is gummed up completely).

To prevent ""MW Laundering"" CA will required in-area generation to make all
capacity
available whenever Stage 1 or higher emergency (i.e., reserves below 7%).
This California
First! rule means the generation must be scheduled against CA loads or bid
into day-ahead
market.  If you don't bid your bid cap is applied.  There will be a capacity
element
similar to RMR.  This change will require FERC buy-in, which obviously will
be
litigation-central, and its likely to create a cascade of similar
requirements from other
states ...

Thanks Andy for the quick summary!

IEP will monitor the Friday call and review all documents to let people know
what is happening.

Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the HPL Liquids contract

0,"Davis' criticism of Texas misdirected, report finds 
Lynda Gledhill, Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff Writers
Tuesday, July 10, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/10/M
N48875.DTL 
Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of 
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power 
crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share 
of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of 
California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private 
energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the 
state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting 
to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting 
against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and 
simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most 
of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying 
the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators 
who have also gouged California. 
""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across 
their face because they are robbing us blind,"" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state 
Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from 
Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are 
made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually 
used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most 
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and 
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped 
as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events 
that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover 
from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in 
receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, 
an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents 
subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged 
market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, 
received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged 
higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 
million.

In response to the below, there was a short planning meeting between 
Commercial Support and IT, specific objectives were identified which would 
enhance the DPR and reporting process, and improve the robustness of our 
processes, the following has been agreed in principle:

1. Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, 
pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.
2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be 
signed off by risk management before end of day.
3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a 
comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's 
portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to 
be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )
4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be 
reported to technical support in the event of a failure.  

The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time 
for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning 
of the next trading day.

Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each 
business area/valuation system for the following:
a) current state
b) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking
c) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - 
Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - 
implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )

Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full 
commercial signoff

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys

		 Subject: California Update 3/06/01


Executive Summary
? If no comprehensive deal is reached by April 9th, chances of bankruptcy 
increase due to a one day ""opt-out"" clause in all long-term power contracts. 
? PG&E and State locked in tough negotiations, several issues on the table:
 PUC-imposed requirement forcing PG&E to ultimately be responsible for 
California energy supplies
 Price of the grid; state - 2.3 times book value vs. PG&E - 4 times book value
? PG&E will not use any of the $1B secured last week to help their ailing 
utility.
? Davis's announcement of long term power contract didn't include some 
details:
 Of the 8,800 megawatts secured this far, only 6,000 are available this 
summer 
 Some of the ""long term contracts"" are really only for three months
 None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot 
market
? One the same day Davis announced long term contracts, Davis also quietly 
announce a 10% rate hike.
? FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal.
 
PG&E
Transmissions deal
One thing that is still uncertain is PG&E.  Bankruptcy may still be a likely 
alternative if current negotiations to buy PG&E's share of the electric 
transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April 9 (when all long-term power 
contracts being negotiated have a one-day ""opt-out"" clause they can exercise 
unilaterally if a ""comprehensive solution"" has not been reached by the state 
and its major utilities).  According to sources close to senior PG&E 
officials, PG&E made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal 
on the transmission lines depends on the California government's willingness 
to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make 
until now. 

PG&E will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to 
relieve it of the PUC-imposed requirement to be the ""electricity buyer of 
last resort.""  Current state regulations make the utility companies 
ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all 
times to supply California's energy needs.  As long as the state steps in and 
makes those purchases, as it has for the past three months, the utilities are 
shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot 
market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings.  
But, PG&E officials are worried 1) this summer's supply and 2) Davis's 
concern over how fast he is draining the state's budget surplus.  If things 
get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state 
will pay only for the electricity it buys through long-term contracts, then 
PG&E will be left holding the bag. 

Thus, as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid, PG&E is 
demanding a ""comprehensive solution"" that includes not being liable for cost 
differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed 
to pay.  State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of ""get out of 
jail free"" card, so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough 
negotiations that are complicated by three other factors: (1) PG&E's public 
behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to 
encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy; (2) State legislative 
demands that the price Davis negotiate for PG&E's part of the electricity 
grid be no more than 2.3 times revenues from the grid; and (3) the FERC must 
""positively approve"" any grid purchase by the state of California. 

The principal concern on the price front is that PG&E wants to sell the 
electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their 
transmission, while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the 
politically acceptable limit.  ""We see 2.3 times book value as an absolute 
upper bound. There is no way PG&E will get more than that, whatever they 
think,"" according to the leader of one main consumer groups.  ""We are going 
to try to force any deals down to about 2.0 in any case."" Negotiators for 
Davis are also trying to 'proposition-proof' any transmission deal to protect 
against a later ballot proposal.  They think there are ways to do that, but 
not if the price of PG&E's part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative.  
Remember, if Davis's eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative, he will 
be running for re-election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed 
to overturn his solution.

On the Sacramento front - no one understands PG&E's motives
The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game 
PG&E is playing.  In a three day period PG&E made a series of announcements 
that left everyone scratching their heads. 
? Late Thursday, PG&E officials leaked information to California papers that 
they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity 
transmission grid to the state, which seemed like obvious good news, but then 
made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30% 
above what the state was currently offering.  While a deal can still be done, 
anything like the $10 billion PG&E wants would be very hard to get through 
the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase. 
? Late Friday, PG&E officials announced that they had secured a $1 billion 
loan for the parent company (not the electricity utility) and would use the 
money to pay off bondholders, other creditors and to return $161 million to 
shareholders in a new dividend payout.  Not a cent of that money was 
earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PG&E and that left at 
least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the 
utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood. 
? Over the weekend, PG&E leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay 
off its energy suppliers' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now.  For 
generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to 
start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy 
action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will 
""make them whole"" in a couple of months, that kind of trial balloon is 
extremely unnerving.

Thus, in a very short time period, PG&E's corporate owners showed they could 
access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they 
were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the 
energy crisis.  Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at 
least a part of the $13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer 
and PG&E's fund-raising will harden and deepen those demands.  As one senior 
political official told our source ""just when you think the corporate 
leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible, they 
come up with something even more outrageous."" 

PG&E's actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to 
construct to solve California's problems.  State Democrats doubt they will 
get Republican support for a deal, which means a vote will fall short of the 
two-thirds majority necessary for immediate enactment (resulting in 90 days 
for the legislation to go into effect).  Additionally, in the past 48 hours, 
many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less 
in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and 
may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the 
electricity grid.

Long-term Contracts - Davis didn't tell the whole truth
Yesterday, Davis announced that he had signed ""long-term"" power deals for 
8,800 megawatts of power, out of a total 12,000 megawatts he wanted to sign 
eventually. According to the press release, Davis is now 75% of the way 
toward his long-term goal and has already solved the hardest part of 
California's energy crisis. This means consumers would maybe pay more than 
necessary five years from now, but these contracts ""guaranteed"" that 
consumers would pay less for the next three years.  What Davis failed to 
highlight was that of the 8,800 megawatt commitment, actually only 6,000 
megawatts are available this summer (when demand is expected to 45,000 
megawatts); and some of these ""long-term contracts"" are actually only good 
for three months.  None of these contracts, however, keep California from 
having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market.

Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year
While the media was concern with Davis's announcement of long term contracts 
for California, of less concern to the media was Davis's quietly announced a 
decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers. The state will 
accept the 10% emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a 
permanent increase as well as an additional 10% increase for consumers that 
will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires. 
That would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour. 

FERC
The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve 
it in a positive vote. Senior California officials and legislators doubt that 
FERC has jurisdiction, and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal. But 
they may be wrong. ""The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs 
off on the deal. Its power over transmission deal is absolute, no matter what 
anyone says,"" according to source close to the President. There are three 
possibilities: 1) FERC could ""pocket veto"" it by not even putting it on 
agenda for discussion; 2) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted 
down. The Democrat on the commission, William Massey, has already said he is 
opposed to it; or 3) the Commission could approve it but with condition that 
Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system.

One complicating factor in the FERC decision, however, is that its chairman 
Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale, may not 
be around long enough to have his say. ""Hebert is definitely not a shoo in 
for the FERC chairman position,"" says one Washington official. Two other 
appointments to the Commission will soon be named, this official notes, and 
one of them ""could easily become chairman.""

Affairs Committee.  According to the Post, each commissioner said they are 
prepared to make ""heavy refunds"" because of overcharging in California.  They 
each said they agreed to give the parties a chance to work it out in the 
upcoming settlement conference first.  The Post article (which was on the 
front page of the business section, perhaps an indication of the somewhat 
diminished press coverage of the issue) mentioned Enron in a list of

Hoyt and Melissa,

I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort 
of services for MG/RW.  It looks like there may be some key personnel we want 
to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.   I am not 
really familiar with the specific facts here.

The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract 
personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their 
activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and 
other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  So, if the plan is 
to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an 
employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a 
supervisor.  Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.

If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers 
-- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.    It 
is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting 
agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other 
alternative).  Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people 
who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk 
of the contract workers.

I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a 
definitive conclusion.  So, let's try to discuss it.  I am booked until about 
11 this morning, but am available after that.

Michelle

Subject: Priviliged and Confidential communication to my attorney Re: Henry 
Bath LA  

Melissa, my concern is that we may get hit with what is called a 
""co-employment suit"" in the US.  This is where an agency employee claims that 
he/she was treated like an employee, therefore he/she should get employee 
benefits (vs. benefits from the agency company, which are probably weak).  
Since we did a share purchase of MG, if the agency employees filed a suit 
against MG claiming that they are really employees, I think that we would 
have to defend it.

I am not an attorney, but I am going to send this to Michelle Cash, who can 
advise us on the position we should take.  I would think that if we single 
out certain employees to become Enron employees and the remainder stay as 
agency employees, this would enhance the legal position of the agency 
employees (versus everyone staying as an agency employee).  Michelle, can you 
help us with this one?  Thanks.

Melissa, I also think we should minimize distribution on this discussion . .

Subject: Henry Bath LA

Hi Hoyt,

I have today spoken to Ed Dablin regarding Henry Bath LA.  We discussed how 
the employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees, although they are 
infact agency workers.  Ed confirmed that Martha and half a dozen other 
employees quite clearly should become Enron employees and should get 
applicable benefits.

The other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should 
become Enron employees and should remain as agency staff.

He realises that the original granting of Share Options has slightly ""muddied 
the water"" with regard to whether these employees are employees of Enron or 
the agency.  He was not involved with the original decision to grant these 
employees Share Options.

We discussed the issues (in broad terms, as I could not remember all of the 
specific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals 
Enron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy 
thing to do.  

However, this is his ideal scenario.  How viable is it that we can do this 
for him?

He also made the point that Martha is the most senior executive in Henry Bath 
Inc. and is one of his most valuable employees.

Regards

Melissa

When he emerged in the mid-1980s at the dawn of new traditionalism, Lyle Lovett had more than a craggy visage to set him apart. His subtle wit, sly humor, and Texas-sized musical eclecticism made him a force. Built around 13 songs from his first three albums, this compendium resoundingly affirms those gifts. One hears his musical metamorphosis from the beginning, through the stomping blues of ""Why I Don't Know,"" the honky-tonk talking blues ""Give Back My Heart,"" and the folkier ""L.A. County"" and...
