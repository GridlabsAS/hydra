I am so sorry for the late notice, but Vince will be in London for 1 day
only,
Monday, October 2nd.  He has had some time freed up and if Paul and
Julian could meet with him, they can call him at the Grosvenor House,
870-400-8500.  His morning is already full, but lunch, dinner or afternoon
would work.

Have fun at the game tonight.  My week is going just fine.  Nothing exciting
to report.  By the way, there is $50 at Mom's that is for you because David
flew home from here last night, and we had to order the ticket on the credit
card.  The ticket was $68.75 so he'll give you the last $20 next time he
sees you.  I hope that is ok.  You had said once that I could always use the
credit card for things like that as long as I paid you back so I did.  You
can either get it from Mom or wait till I get home and I'll bring it to you.
With all the prom excitement I completely forgot to give it to you before we
left - sorry.  Anyway, this week is pretty boring for me because I have
nothing due and no exams.  I'm glad to have a light week, but it leaves for
a lot of boredom and down time.  I may have to find something to do
like......SHOP!!!!!  No I'm just kidding - I wouldn't do that.  Well, I'll
talk to you sometime this week and have fun tonight.  I hope the rugrats

0,"Joe Allen has requested a $500 PAC contribution for Pat Rosenberg, a 
candidate running for HISD.  She is the wife of an Enron employee.  I have 
not requested contributions in school board races since our PAC funds are 
limited.  (Another Enron employee asked for $1000 PAC contribution for 
someone he was personally supporting for school board.)      

Elizabeth Linnell gathered some historical data regarding PAC contributions 
to education candidates:

 The PAC made contributions to the following organizations in 1997 and 1999 
at $1,000 in each case:
  Houston Citizens for Better Education
  Houston Friends for Better Education
  Houston Parents for Better Education
  Houston Taxpayers for Better Education

 In 1995 the PAC gave $500 to Lori Becker, a school board candidate.

Joe said that Pat Rosenberg has $20,000 in her campaign fund and he is trying 
to help her get more money in, as soon as possible, to get her numbers up.  
What are your thoughts regarding PAC contributions to school board 
candidates?  I asked the same question of Sue Walden several weeks ago, and 
she indicated that she does not get involved in school board races.  Thanks,

Hi Janine,

As discussed here is our list of topics we feel the 'Sleeving' Agreement 
should cover.  We think that it should remain as broad as possible to avoid a 
delay in Legal negotiations over the finer details.

Please let us know your thoughts and we will send these up to Justin.  If you 
could please review this as soon as possible, we would appreciate it as 
Justin is out of the office next week.

Confidentiality - covering all EnronOnline applications and trading strategies
Performance of obligation to deliver / receive product
Invoices and Confirmations - confirmations for EOL deals should be processed 
by MG staff and sent out with proper Enron entity, also send confirms to Enron
Assumption of underlying position by MG - Enron fully transfers positions to 
MG
Provision of data feeds - i.e. information to the Credit Aggregation System 
and/or to the RAC value at risk system
Information provision- for Management Reporting purposes
Compensation for Credit risk taken? -  please advise if you feel this is 
necessary.

Thank you!

0,"The memo distributed on June 27 on Reimbursement of Individually Billed Items 
requires
clarification.  The intent of the memo was to give employees an alternate 
method
of paying for pagers, cell phones, etc.  Employees can continue to submit 
these
invoices to Accounts Payable for processing or  pay these items with their 
corporate
American Express card and request reimbursement through an expense report.

I can be your contact for Louisiana Resources.  However, as I stated earlier, I need to know which Louisiana Resources you are talking about.  Is it Louisiana Resources Company or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership.

For Bridgeline the contact would be Robert D. Morgan.  His phone number is 713-345-6374.

Gerald, this is just to follow up on the voicemail message I left for you
this afternoon.  Can you please provide me with contact information for reps
from both Louisiana Resources and Bridgeline.  The transfer of control
applications to be filed with the FCC require signatures from reps from both
parties to the transaction.  We will need this info before we can file the
applications.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

Thanks Gerald, this info is helpful.  Do you know who owns the other 60%
equity interest in Bridgeline, and how the LP is structured to give Enron
50% control with only 40% interest?

Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:

     1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
     2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are
currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.
     3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new
after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info?
     4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you
forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.
Do you agree, Robert?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They
were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's
40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these
licenses has been filed.

Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the
licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into
Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America
Corp.

   Gerald, this is just to follow up on our prior phone conversations re:
   the
   sale of Louisiana Resources' assets (including licenses) to Bridgeline .
   As
   I mentioned, what is important to our inquiry is whether transfer of
   applications were filed prior to the consummation of the above
   transaction
   whereby the assets of Louisiana Resources' were acquired.  I will need
   the
   following transaction information:

   *  When did the transaction close?  The exact date. 2/?/2000
   *  Which licenses where part of that transaction?
   *  Which licenses were obtained by filing a new application after the
   transaction date?
   *  Which stations are constructed/operating?

   As a reminder, we are under a deadline to get this information to the
   FCC.
   To make the deadline I will need the information by tomorrow or Monday
   at
   the latest.  Please call/email with any questions.

   Thanks and have a Happy Thanksgiving.

0,"Gentlemen,

Could we schedule some time for a conference call next week?  I would 
appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the legal issues.  I have 
the lofty goal of not working Memorial Day weekend this year, so I'm trying 
to get as much done on this deal as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  I'm open Tues am and most of Wednesday.  I can probably work my schedule 
so that I'm available quite a bit of next week."

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Subject: PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."

0,"Ken Lay spoke with several California CEOs this morning and urged them to get 
personally involved in pushing for a comprehensive set of reforms.  Three 
expressed willingness to help.

Scott McNealy (Sun):  contact person - Piper Cole (piper.cole@sun.com); 
scott.mcnealy@engeng.sun.com.  Mcnealy wants, by close of business today, a 
""cheat sheet"" of the talking points to use with politicians (the ""8 or 10 
elements of the solution"") with the expected comeback he may hear from the 
political leaders and our response to that comeback.  He says he hasn't spent 
time working on issues in Sacremento so we may also want to include a list of 
suggested contacts.
Kevin Sharer (Amgen): contact person - Sarah Jensen, VP of Engineering and 
Operations (805.447.6785); ksharer@amgen.com.  Sharer wants the same 
information as McNealy and he and McNealy both indicated their willingness to 
call a meeting of other California CEOs.  Sharer will also be having 
breakfast with Hertzberg one week from today.
Robert Day (Trust Co of the West):  said that he is very close to the mayor 
of Los Angeles.  He urged Ken to call the mayor (mentioning Day).  Ken would 
like some talking points for that call.

Subject: ENA Adjustment at Nville

The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been 
discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have 
discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's 
inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.

I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are 
correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.

The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of 
the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, 
there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA 
values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet 
and the ""official"" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.

To summarize:
 Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU.
 Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU.


Call me if there are any questions.

In preparation for the meeting with the lenders on Tuesday I was reviewing 
the GSA and I wonder if YPF has any force majeure claims which could impede 
our rights to terminate.  I know they indicated at least verbally that they 
had encountered some problems in Argentina.  Although a stretch has Dean or 
Novak indicated that this could be a defense?"

UK: UK Coalpower keen for 500MW station at Hatfield.

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Coalpower, the company set up by former RJB Mining chief Richard Budge, says it would like to build a coal-fired power station near its newly acquired Hatfield colliery in South Yorkshire, northern England. 
""We are keen to build a 500 megawatt clean coal power plant and are talking to various people"", Budge told Reuters on Thursday, adding the chances of such a station coming to fruition would be closely linked to the outcome of Britain's current review of its energy needs to 2050.
""Let's see what comes out of the energy review - if it's positive for coal gasification it will not just be our plant that will be built, others will be."" 
Coalpower acquired the Hatfield coal mine on Monday, beating off competition from U.S. energy group Enron and UK Coal (formerly RJB Mining) and is spending about five million pounds ($8.4 million) to restart production. 
Budge said Hatfield has the potential to become a long-life pit with its 100 million tonnes of contiguous coal reserves and he is looking for output in excess of 500,000 tonnes a year. 
""Hatfield is the optimum site for a coal gasification combined cycle plant"", said Budge, adding Britain needed coal generation to maintain a balanced and diverse energy portfolio. 
The government has said it is concerned about Britain's projected dependence on imported natural gas. 
Conventional coal burning power stations are high in fossil fuel emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to global warming. But gasification combined cycle technology converts coal to a gaseous fuel from which most of the impurities are removed prior to combustion. 
Supporters of coal say the clean coal technology can address many of the environmental concerns of burning coal. 
Coal mining in Britain has been in decline for decades, but the fuel still accounts for about a third of its power generation and recent signs point to the industry enjoying a mini revival. 
A doubling in the price of British natural gas over the last year has led to a rise in coal demand as electricity generators seek out the cheapest fuel in a highly competitive market. The increased demand for coal has propelled prices to about 35 pounds a tonne compared with 22.50 #18 months ago.

Enron's Azurix faces damages claim if rescinds Buenos Aires water contract

BUENOS AIRES (AFX) - Enron Corp water and sewage unit Azurix Buenos Aires SA faces a claim for compensation unless it reverses plans to rescind its concession to provide the province's water and sewage services, financial daily Buenos Aires Economico reported. 
The damages claim would be filed by public prosecutor Ricardo Szelagowski, the newspaper cited provincial secretary for public services, Eduardo Sicaro, as saying.
Azurix said earlier this week it will rescind the concession on Jan 2, but continue operating the service ""until the provincial authorities, or the operator it designates, take charge of assets and operations"".

Enron backs away from Coburg plant

10/12/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

COBURG, Ore. (AP) - Enron will not be a partner in a proposed natural gas power plant here, the project's managing director said Thursday. 
But Gary Marcus, who owns Coburg Power, said losing the Texas-based conglomerate will not stop the project.
""Enron never drove this deal,"" he said. ""I invited Enron into the deal."" 
Marcus said Enron's participation improved the quality of the plant's design but slowed the decision-making process. Marcus predicted he will find a new backer in less than six months and will have a license to build the project within a year. 
Enron backed out because the project did not meet its market strategy, Marcus said. 
Enron officials couldn't be reached for comment. 
Enron's departure will do little to appease local residents, who fear that the power plant will harm ground water and air quality. 
""I don't think it'll ever be built,"" said Kent Johnston of Coburg, a project opponent. ""If the people of Coburg and Eugene have anything to say about it, it won't be."" 
Added Joey Gayles, a committee chairman in the residents' opposition group, ""We're going to fight (Marcus) tooth and nail."" 
The proposed 40-acre site north of Coburg meets all criteria for construction of a 300-megawatt plant on 12 acres of the site, Marcus said. The remainder of the site would be used for buffer area and wetlands mitigation. 
An additional eight acres will be required for the 600-megawatt plant that Coburg Power wants to build, he said. The larger plant would require additional permits that might delay the project. 
Expanding the existing natural gas pipeline that runs under the site also would add to the plant's cost. The larger plant would generate the equivalent of all power currently consumed in Lane County. 
Marcus estimated the cost of the larger plant at $300 million to $400 million. The smaller plant would cost about $180 million, he said.

UK Crt Blocks Challenge To Intl Arbitration In Enron Spat

10/12/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

BOMBAY (AP)--A Commercial Court in London has restrained an Indian state government from blocking international arbitration proceedings by the U.S. power giant Enron to recover claims of up to $5 billion, a company statement said Friday. 
""The injunction facilitates a timely and impartial review by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between the Dabhol Power Company and the Maharashtra state government,"" said the statement issued in Bombay, India's financial capital.
Wednesday's court injunction in London is expected to block the state government's move to settle the dispute in India through the state-owned Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission. 
Enron said the original contract for the disputed Dabhol power project required international arbitration. The company accused the state government of using a delaying tactic by trying to halt the international arbitration in favor of a settlement procedure in India. 
Enron has a 65% stake in the Dabhol Power Co. Its 2,184-megawatt power project is India's biggest foreign investment. In phase one of the project, Enron supplied electricity from naphtha for its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which has said it can't afford the prices negotiated seven years ago. 
The contract included a federal government guarantee to cover any nonpayment. Enron has said guarantee hasn't been met, despite two notices to the federal government. 
The second part of the project, more than 90% complete, involves building a new plant to produce electricity from liquefied natural gas, and a container ship port to import it. 
Houston-based Enron says it has halted construction for the second phase and it was costing hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Enron wants to pull out of India and recover its entire investment and that of its partners, General Electric and Bechtel Corp.

INDIA PRESS:State Govt Restrained From Challenging Dabhol

10/12/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- The Commercial Court of London has restrained India's Maharashtra state government from filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by Dabhol Power Co., reports the Hindu Business Line. 
Dabhol Power is an Indian unit of U.S.-based energy company Enron Corp. (ENE).
The newspaper says Dabhol obtained the court order Thursday, and the state government has 23 days to respond. 
Dabhol is locked in a long-standing payment dispute with its sole buyer, Maharashtra State Electricity Board. 
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol. Costing $2.9 billion, the project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date. Newspaper Web site: www.thehindubusinessline.com

India: Enron may seek $30 m to exit Greenfield

10/12/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)

NEW DELHI, Oct. 11 ENRON is looking at a price of about $30 million for exiting from Greenfield Shipping Company, in which one of its affiliates, Atlantic Commercial Inc, is a 20 per cent equity partner. 
While Enron's 20 per cent stake in the $220-million LNG venture for Dabhol Power Company comes to $11 million, the Houston-based company is understood to have put up a price of $30 million for exiting from Greenfield, bankers familiar with the developments told Business Line.
The $30 million price pegged by Enron for its 20 per cent stake comprises $11 million for equity and $19 million for swapping the company's share of the loan liabilities, the sources said. 
Though Atlantic Commercial Inc is yet to make an official statement on pulling out of the LNG shipping deal, it is understood to have conveyed to the project lenders led by ANZ Investment Bank that such a decision was imminent in view of Enron's plan to exit from Dabhol Power Company. 
The State-run Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is a 20 per cent partner in Greenfield, while the remaining 60 per cent equity in the joint venture consortium is held by Japan's Mitsui O.S.K.Lines. 
In view of the controversy surrounding the power plant, the lenders to the LNG shipping deal have declared an event of default and suspended the last tranche of the project loan worth $55 million. The ANZ Investment Bank-led consortium has already pumped in $110 million out of a total loan commitment of $165 million for the 137,000 cubic metre capacity tanker being build at Mitsubishi's yard in Japan. 
The three promoters will now have to put in additional investments to the tune of $55 million to take possession of the vessel on the scheduled delivery date of November 15. 
The board of SCI has not been able to come to a conclusion on putting in extra funds in the project despite discussing the issue several times. A board meet held on Tuesday to discuss the issue again ended in stalemate, Government sources said. 
SCI's dilemma on making extra investments in the project also centre around the fate of Enron's equity in the deal. In the event of Enron pulling out of the LNG shipping project, its 20 per cent equity would have to be taken over by the two remaining partners. Besides, these two partners would also have to pool-in the additional investments of $55 million amongst themselves in proportion to their revised equity holdings. 
""However, there is a great question mark over whether Mitsui and SCI should agree to take over the equity of Enron"", the sources said. 
During discussions held in London recently, Mitsui had clearly told the lenders that it was not in favour of putting in extra funds to salvage the LNG shipping deal. 
Moreover, with the consortium now looking at a charter hire rate of $60,000 to $65,000 per day as against the rate of $98,600 per day agreed with Dabhol Power Company, both SCI and Mitsui feels that the revised charter hire rates would render their investments unviable. 
According to estimates, at a charter hire rate of $60,000 per day, Greenfield is expected to earn about $22 million per annum. Out of this, $4-$5 million will be spent on operating expenses of the tanker. 
The remaining $17-18 million will fetch an internal rate of return (IRR) of 7-8 per cent for Mitsui at an equity stake of 60 per cent. 
""Mitsui feels that an IRR of this level was not sufficient for their investments"", the sources said. 
Whereas, for SCI, the investments would fetch a return of 4-4.5 per cent. ""This will be far below the Government norm of 12 per cent IRR for projects involving State-funding,"" the sources said.

India: Dabhol gets restraint order from UK court

10/12/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd

MUMBAI, Oct. 11 THE Commercial Court of London has given an ex parte order restraining the Maharashtra Government from filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by Dabhol Power Company (DPC). 
The Enron-promoted DPC obtained the order today and the State has 23 days to respond. Maharashtra has been restrained from ""commencing or prosecuting or continuing or taking any steps in or otherwise participating in proceedings in any court or tribunal in India in restraint of or otherwise relating to the three arbitrations"", the order said. The three arbitrations relate to State guarantees to the project.
A DPC spokesman said now ""the arbitration process in London would continue as originally contemplated and agreed by the State Government and DPC. This has no bearing on the on-going proceedings involving DPC, MSEB and MERC before the Mumbai High Court and Supreme Court"". 
He also said Maharashtra is not a party to any of the on-going proceedings before the Mumbai High Court and the Supreme Court. ""Over the past few months, the State Government and other Government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations. 
This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago. The injunction facilitates the timely and impartial review by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between DPC and the State,"" the company said. 
The arbitration panel had been constituted sometime ago and proceedings were expected to begin any time. 
However, the proceedings could not take off as a dispute over the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission had dragged on to the Mumbai High Court and then the Supreme Court. 
Both courts had restrained DPC from continuing international arbitration pending resolution of the MERC jurisdiction issue. The State Government was expected to file a civil suit in the Mumbai High Court accusing the company of fraud and misrepresentation. Internal differences in the Government and the legal team over proving ""fraud"" had led to the resignation of the State counsel.

USA: Sempra's fiber/natgas technology could begin in Dec.

10/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A Sempra Energy unit said on Thursday its new system for running fiber-optic cable through natural gas pipelines, in turn leaving city streets intact, could begin commercial service in December. 
Putting fiber-optic lines in existing natural gas pipelines - which already have cleared rights-of-way - could tackle the telecommunications industry's ""last mile"" problem of connecting end users to outlying fiber-optic cable networks without tearing up roadways.
A surge in demand for high-speed Internet access has led telecommunications companies to pour billions of dollars into vast nationwide fiber-optic systems that carry data to computers, phones and screens faster than traditional copper wires. 
Sempra Fiber Links, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy, made the announcement after its first installation of the technology in the gas distribution system of Frontier Energy, a Sempra Energy unit in North Carolina. 
Sempra's technology involves encasing fiber-optic cable in a protective polyethylene conduit before inserting it through the same local gas lines serving utility customers. 
The company said installing the cable would not prevent a utility from servicing its gas lines or keeping them safe. 
Jennifer Andrews, a Sempra Fiber Links spokeswoman, said the company was discussing its fiber-in-gas system with gas utilities throughout the United States. 
SAVINGS 
Andrews said companies using the technology could save from 30 percent to 50 percent on last mile costs compared with traditional trenching and installation methods. 
Sempra Energy unit Southern California Gas Co., one of the largest gas utilities in the U.S. with about 18 million customers, plans to use fiber-in-gas technology in its system as soon as it is approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
Energy companies that have ventured into the fiber-optic business by building infrastructure and/or through bandwidth trade, include Williams Cos ., El Paso Corp. ., Enron Corp. , Dynegy Inc. , Duke Energy , Consolidated Edison Inc. and Montana Power Co. . 
In March 2000, Montana Power announced plans to divest its energy business and invest the proceeds into its broadband and telecommunications unit Touch America.

The meeting will be held at 8:30 a.m. (CST) in the Imperial Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  Unfortunately, the full ballroom was not available until late May, but we did not want to put off the meeting until then.
Capacity at the Hyatt will be limited to 1,400 people seated, with additional room for approximately 200 people standing.  As an alternative to attending the meeting, employees in Houston will be able to listen to a live audio stream and view the slide presentation on their computers at http://home.enron.com/employeemeeting/.  The question and answer portion of the meeting will not be broadcasted.  Shortly after the meeting, the audio broadcast and the slide presentation will be available for all employees at home.enron.com.
Given the current environment and continuing media interest surrounding Enron, we will take extra security precautions at the Hyatt.  Employees attending the meeting will be required to show their current photo employee badge and each badge will be crosschecked with a current employee list.  No one will be permitted into the meeting without their badge.  Due to space constraints, contract workers will not be permitted to attend the meeting.  We recognize that this security process will take time, so check-in will begin at 7:45 a.m. We apologize for any inconvenience this process creates and appreciate your understanding and patience.
We encourage you to submit questions for the meeting in advance.  Please send them via email to ""Office of the Chief Executive""."

It was most likely a rental unit.
(2)  Increase in field pressures late last week was due to a compressor
going down.  Overhaul of that unit was not complete until late yesterday

deal.  However, I think that we should limit ourselves to those things that 
effect the time and amount of the EAM volumes.  Even here, such a problem set 
is quite large.  If you glance at the spreadsheet model, you will notice that 
there exists a large number of possible items that effect the EAM volumes.  
If we are to do this rigorously, then it is necessary to tear apart EES's 
business model, and although such an attempt to do so would be noble, the 
scope of such an excercise may be too large.  We need a clear definition of 
EES Operational Risk.

 Briefly, from the EES deals that I have looked at, two things drive their 
profit:  a long term bet that power prices will go down, and that we can 
improve the facility through various enhancements.  Each of these may be 
gleaned from the spreadsheet, as well as the assumptions regarding the 
funding of the facility improvements and so on.  95% of the savings is 
assumed to come from power, and 5% from gas.  (The effeciency gain may not be 
explicitly given).  If we have data that show the realized efficiency gains, 
then it would be simple [in principle] to determine a distribution, and hence 
a distribution of EAM volumes, NPV's, etc.  At this time, I understand that 
RAC has determined some of the realized efficiency gains, but my knowledge is 
quite sketchy.  Jay Hachen may have more info.

 If I get a chance, I will try to see if I can do a ""proof of concept"" 
excercise, but I have a late January deadline on something else.

 Another point:  even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet 
model, EES has chosen to book things differently.  I do not have a thorough 
understanding of their IT systems, but at least in principle, if we can do 
this for the spreadsheet model, then we can do it in their IT environment 
(data are data are data).  They may book efficiency gains through improvement 
type, such as gains due to compressors, chillers, boilers, etc.  If this is 
indeed the case, then we need to have distributions for each type of 
improvement.   

 If we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their IT 
systems, then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system.  It 
would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by Excel 
workbooks.  It can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run 
simulations and queries, but this would probably take me about five or six 
weeks.

 Finally, Don Hawkins does Operational Audits for Enron's physical assets.  
He sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets.  I don't 
think that he does it for EES, but you might want to give him a call anyway.

PS:  The EES lunch meeting has been moved to Wednesdays.  Jay Hachen will

Ted.  Therefore, telling him about the shirt was right in character for me.  
I think a part of him probably felt a little ashamed that a 23 yr. old girl 
with almost no dating experience could handle the situation with more class 
than him.  Anyway, there were a few other things established and solidified 
last night by Ted - 1. By his own admission, I am definitely smarted than him 
(while in the past I have challenged that I had to agree last night) 2. I am 
a confident, probably too much so, and well-adjusted individual.  Merely 
taking into account those two points, Ted in his present ""condition"" could 
never be a match for me.  I would either always feel like I was carrying him 
or rolling over him.  I'm still absolutely floored by the fact I have now 
dated a divorcee.  Does Chuck think less of me for being duped?  I hope 
not...he really seemed like a good (to everyone that met him).

I think Mom, Dad and I are all going to fly over on the same flight 
(Singapore Airlines).  I found a great deal from San Francisco for around 
$580.  I of course will have to fly from Houston which ups the fare to $800, 
but it's still the best deal around.  I can't wait to see you guys.

Subject: the weirdo has shown his true colors finally, and not just by e mail


First of all sorry about the ""overjealous"" not
""overzealous"" in my last e mail--it was late.

Anyway, to the important stuff...I think that's the
problem with dating 30 something guys who aren't
married.  Either a divorce in the past or too many
other hang ups (and this guy looks like he fits into
both categories).  I know that everyone says that, but
in my observation it has been true.  So you're stuck
between a rock and a hard place.  You want the
maturity level of someone like him, but sometimes
those older men are too much of a headache.  I'm glad
you at least got to say your toughts.  I can't believe
you told him about the t-shirt!  Oh well, what did you
have to lose by getting it all out there.  I'm glad
your questions are answered now.  I guess there really
wasn't anything he could say to fix things between you
guys!  I guess you'll just have to keep going to Steak
Night.

When he emerged in the mid-1980s at the dawn of new traditionalism, Lyle Lovett had more than a craggy visage to set him apart. His subtle wit, sly humor, and Texas-sized musical eclecticism made him a force. Built around 13 songs from his first three albums, this compendium resoundingly affirms those gifts. One hears his musical metamorphosis from the beginning, through the stomping blues of ""Why I Don't Know,"" the honky-tonk talking blues ""Give Back My Heart,"" and the folkier ""L.A. County"" and...

Subject:	Counterparty Guarantor Addendum to Adoption Agreement

Various discussions took place Friday afternoon as to advisability of inserting a provision designed to bind (or at least make an attempt to bind ) current Counterparty Guarantors to obligations under the Adoption Agreement/ERMT Master Agreements.  

A quick fix that ""hopefully"" does not significantly disrupt the work you may have already done on your Adoption Agreements is to insert the language contained in the attached document just below the signature lines of all Adoption Agreements, only in those cases where the Master being adopted is currently supported by a guaranty issued by Counterparty's parent or other credit support provider/guarantor.  The required revisions to the form language should be fairly self-explanatory, but please call me with any questions.

If you see problems with the specific language (not the idea) of the Addendum, please call me ASAP. 

Thanks for your understanding and assistance,

Steve

For the Financial Masters I will draft and email shortly another paragraph that will need to be added to the Adoption Agreement to cover the situation where the counterparty has provided a parent guaranty under the ENA Master Agreement.  The paragraph will provide for the adoption of the terms of that guaranty for purposes of the ERMT Master and necessitate the signature of the guarantor on the Adoption Agreement.

Importance:	High

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it ""reinserts"" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

Either they have spare time or they are doing it in their sleep.  I really

that and yet I know Tracy is trying to get pg.  She says she is tired of 
always having her legs in the air.  I know she doesn't have any spare time.  
Maybe she utilizes her time by doing two things at once.  Like eating dinner

Vince,

Sounds good!  It will take two or three days for me to strip out, reformat, 
and assemble the Kaminski columns(since we didn't do this last year, I'm 
guessing you mean all columns since the beginning), so I envision us being 
ready with the completed set the first part of next week.  I assume that you 
would like me to omit those people who have moved on?

Also,  on page three of the first volume, you had written an introduction.  I 
have updated  the content for volume two, but would you perhaps like to do a 
new one?

additional Volume I's printed, too.  Would you mind disposing of the other

Dave, its good to hear from you.
We are in Houston and its hot!   My wife is doing great and we are still trying to get used to life in Houston.     
I am trading in Ercot region (Texas) and, of course,  Brett is now working at the ISO.    
MY WIFE AND I MISS PORTLAND
Working in the main office isnt as much fun as working in Portland.    There is a good chance that I will return to PDX, as there are so many good people there and so much to do outdoors. 
So, tell me what you are doing now in Phoenix.    Everyone that I've met from SRP has been very nice,  (Perry,  John Sullivan,  etc.).   Hope you enjoy working there and all is well with your family.

0,"Attached is a file with my allocations of Texas Operations to be used for the 
2000 Plan.  However, please note that their are some problems/clean-up that 
needs to occur that I could not do.

As you requested, I have taken the % we allocated to Gas Assets last year and 
put the appropriate %'s into the appropriate group within Gas Assets as you 
have broken them out.  Please note:  Gas Network Trading is the same group as 
ST GasTexas (group 8) - Tom Martin is responsible for both.  I have indicated 
the appropriate %'s into the NEW buckets, but I was not able to ZERO out the 
ST GasTexas group as the cells are protected.  Consequently, the TOTAL column 
indicates that I have allocated over 100%.  The #'s in Gas Network Trading 
are correct.  Will you please delete ST GasTexas so that no one will allocate 
to it?
When the plan allocations were submitted last year, there was an error in 
RC1160 - Volume Management.  I thought we corrected it but it is still 
showing up incorrectly.  Please move the 8% under East Origin to ST GasEast.  
I was not able to correct this either as the cells have been protected.  
Please note:  This is not a change from the plan, but a correction of an 
error. 

I would appreciate you correcting these things for me, and forwarding the 
corrected version back to me for my records.  I will be working with our 
management team on the 1/00 allocations, and will provide you those by 
Friday.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.


MANAGEMENT TEAM:  Please review, and work on how we should be allocated for 
1/00.  We have changes for Denver business, Project Sally, NewCo, etc.  We 
will discuss in the staff meeting on Tuesday, 1/18.

 Dad, & Linda-
Can you go ahead and contact the band, I sent an e-mail to the wedding 
coordinator and she has not responded (she is new to e-mail) and I'm afraid 
we might lose them. Also, she recommended a photographer out of Atlanta, I 
love his work, he does candid more so than the traditional portraits. He also 
did a number of the Kennedy's weddings, etc. I'll try and get a price quote, 
but I might need your help in negotiations. Also, she send some information 
on a decorator/ florist who seems phenomenal, I don't know if Linda might be 
willing to help me out with that as she knows a lot more about both flowers 
and decoration than I do. The Ballroom at the Ritz is pretty basic and he can 
turn it into anything but basic. Also, that we if we find a church that is 
not so amazing, he can decorate that as well. 
The name of the photographer is Dennis Reggie and his number is 404- 
873-8088.  Linda Kessler has all the information on the florist, her number 
is 888 524 1326.
Mom is going to be responsible for the RSVP's for the wedding.  I will get a 
fax machine this weekend. 
Let me know if this is a problem and I will try and arrange some of this from 
down here, it is just difficult for people to call internationally.
I love you!

0,"Hello Everyone,
Please find below the issues, action taken, and action plan / proposed 
resolution for GCP / SAP / Mid Office Systems interface.
If you have further questions/comments, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,
Janet

Issues:
Brazil and Argentina Tax Code - Counterparty tax code for these countries are 
required in SAP but not in GCP.
Bank Partner Type Changes - Partner bank type changes for counterparties -- 
triggered by master data changes in GCP -- while bank data remains the same, 
resulting in invoices being paid to the incorrect bank and/or bank account.
Ownership - who owns what?

Action Taken:
Brazil and Argentina Tax Code
Meeting took place.  Agreed upon plan is for mid office user to provide tax 
requirements and/or codes to Bill.  SAP is waiting for tax requirements 
and/or codes to determine whether user exits should be disable (these are 
custom user exits SAP has implemented to accommodate the Brazil and Argentina 
tax requirements back from 1/01/00 go-live)
Bank Partner Type
Our understanding is GCP has agreed to modify the GCP program to keep bank 
partner type static.  GCP technical team is developing this solution.
Ownership
Mid Office Users own data
GCP maintains counterparty master data
GCP and SAP ensure that solution in place to move master data from GCP to SAP 
satisfy invoicing and cash processing business requirements.

Summary:
Many meetings have taken place.  Major progress has been made.  Now we need 
to evaluate GCP reengineering initiative to see whether it affects scope  and 
requirements regarding current solution in place for this 3-way interface.

Proposed Resolution:
SWAT team representing both Houston and London to be formed and meet in 
London week of Sep. 11- 15th to:
Address all issues evolving around this interface.
Develop solutions to issues, workplan, ownership, and timeline.
SWAT team members:
Janet Tran - SAP TRAPAR
Pamela LeBrane - SAP TRAPAR
Diem Pham - SAP Technical  -- Will already be in London that week for EEL
Bill Hare - GCP Functional (Houston)
Mary Solmonson - GCP Functional (Global)  -- Will already be in London that 
week for other business
Energy Operations Reprentative(s) - with Brazil / Argentina tax knowledge
Bhautik Patel - GCP Functional (London)
Brian Hunter-Lindsay - GCP Functional (London)
John Paskin - SAP London"

0,"Group,

Due to the recent drop in day-ahead prices, we have a few counterparties who scheduled less than their P-max generation.  Therefore, we need to submit supplemental bids so they will be covered in case the ISO calls on their generation (for the difference between the P-max and their prescheduled generation).

Additionally, if you can make an SC to SC trade with this generation please do.  If you are able to do an SC trade, please make sure it's for at least a 4 hour run.  Make sure you're in contact with the control rooms to let them know what you're doing.  And if you do make an SC to SC trade, don't forget to take out the supplemental bids for those hours.

So, please submit supplemental bids, or sell as an SC to SC trade for Harbor, Delano, Wheelabrator Martel, and Sierra Pacific Industries.

Harbor:
Supps:		80mw, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $140.
SC Trade:	80mw, SP15, Friday and Saturday, above $125.

Delano:
Supps:		15mw, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $40.
SC Trade:	15mw, SP15, Friday and Saturday, above $40.

Wheelabrator Martel:
Supps:		6mw, HE1-24, Friday and Saturday, for $60.
SC Trade:	6mw, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $50.

Sierra Pacific Industries:
Supps:		No Supps, we are not their SC.  The APX is their SC.
SC Trade:	30mw, NP15, Friday and Saturday, above $60.


If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask either Chris Foster or myself.

Thanks,
Stan"

What do you think about  my/ENE attending given the current press?  The Program Agenda has already been printed up and published.  I think bailing out may send a bad message, however, I would completely understand.  I think I can stay in the middle of the fairway and definitely avoid any inappropriate questions or discussions.

Jeff, will Enron be attending this meeting?  IBM would be interested in
receiving a report from this event.  We would also like to discuss
potential impacts/options for our CA sites.  Thanks.


The ISO will be hosting a Participating Load Stakeholder
meeting on September 20, 2000 at the ISO.  The meeting is a broad
stakeholder meeting to help refine our load participation programs for
2001.
Much of the day will be committed to presentations and discussions on
lessons learned from 2000 and proposals for 2001, including technical
standards, contractual issues, and load management.

          Some vendors have approached the ISO with systems that would
aggregate loads, give them an opportunity to curtail based on day ahead
energy prices, and provide the curtailment instructions and verifications.
This type of program may be ultimately sold to ESPs or IOUs. In order to
accelerate the testing of such systems the ISO may sponsor a pilot program
to test the system/approach with selected vendors.  The pilot program will
test the concepts, the interfaces, and assist in bringing together vendors,
ESPs, SCs, and the IOUs as we move forward toward improving demand
responsiveness in our markets.  We have reserved about 1 -2 hours in the
afternoon, to allow 3-4 vendors to present their approaches to the
stakeholder group.

          In addition, we welcome you to visit a vendor fair that the
ISO is hosting on September 21, 2000.  The ISO has      experienced
considerable interest from the market place in such a vendor fair that
would
include entities providing Data Processing Gateway technology for both
Generators and Loads in the Participating Ancillary Services Load Program.
This effort is being encouraged to develop multiple solutions pertaining to
installations of direct telemetry for Generators and Load providing
Ancillary Services to the ISO markets.

          The agendas are attached for both events, including
directions and lodging information.
          Please RSVP by September 13, 2000 to Sue Happ at
shapp@caiso.com.
          Thank you.

About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a
concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for
Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001).

Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not interested.
It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could perhaps help me
with your reasoning.  Did we approach you  too late (given the Dec 4
deadline)?   We required all participants to pay registration fees, was
that an issue?   We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a
session, was that an  issue?

Thanks in advance for your response.

Subject: Questions re: Siemens Negotiations




Rob - We've reviewed your memo which sets forth general points of your
negotiations with Siemens.  Following are comments and questions regarding
certain negotiated points:

EOT Claim Agreement

Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on oil;
if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 
commissioning
obligations

We observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner
to correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations, it is
introduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the
owner for affecting the Contractor's ability to commission.

Risk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas

We understand that the Facility is under the care, custody and control of the
Owner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance 
coverage
intended for the commercial operating period (versus the construction period).
Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance 
coverage
if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor
action during commissioning on gas.  We are also advising the Lenders to have
this point reviewed by an insurance advisor.

Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during
commissioning

During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to
test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of
curves.  It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach.
We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the
benefit of Siemens.  We trust that your operations experts will diligently
review the basis for the curves.

Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven by
owner

Please explain the rationale behind forgiving $4 million of Contractor LDs.

Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas

During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand
down until 7/1/01 when gas is available, no LDs would be paid related to oil
firing performance, and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is
not complete within 60 days.  We do not understand the above negotiated point.
Please confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated
point.

TAA Agreement

No 12-month look back.

We assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored 
into
the availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an
extension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result 
of
dropping below the availability standards.  Please explain how this negotiated
point affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how 
availability
will be calculated.  As we noted during our last conference call, we are
concerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if
maintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not
being dispatched.

12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas
commissioning unless owner delay.

We interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the 12-month clock for 
the
initial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it
takes the Contractor to commission on gas (unless delays are attributable to
Owner) and re-starts after Contractor has successfully completed the 
performance
testing on gas.  Please confirm that our understanding is correct.

In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if
there are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated
that we will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business
interruption insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve
the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects,
design, and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.
Incidentally, for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which
is not a new technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18
months per event with US$150,000 deductible.

Stone & Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review 
this
point.

Thanks in advance for your response.  Hope all is well.

Regards,

Bradley

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1236&> , WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01
Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1859&> , WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/28/01
A banged-up Smith Toe/knee) will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback. 

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay. Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/28/01
Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day."" 

Doug Brien <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1393&>, K IND - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the c! lu! b wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/28/01
According to the Pro Football News and Injury Report, Green has asthma, but he has practiced fully this week and will start against the Vikings. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/27/01
Thrash is listed as questionable with an ankle injury, but he is expected to play against the Giants. 

Patrick Jeffers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1515&> , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 12/27/01
Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/27/01
The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday. If he cannot practice fully on Thursday, Spergon Wynn will get the start this week.

MISSOURI
Lawmakers seek to oust three PSC members

Rep. Dennis Bonner (D., District 51) and Sen. Ronnie DePasco (D.,
District 11) are trying to oust three members of the Public Service
Commission who refused to hold a public hearing before the PSC approved
a Missouri Gas Energy application to raise its rates by 44%.  Bonner
filed a resolution in the House yesterday afternoon seeking the removal
of the commissioners, and DePasco plans to file an identical resolution
in the Senate today, Bonner told TR.

The 44% rate hike was ""ridiculous,"" Bonner told TR.  ""People in my
district can't afford to pay that.""  Bonner said, however, that he
""would have been happy if [the commissioners] would have held a
hearing.""  Bonner said he and DePasco had warned the PSC in advance that
they would try to expel any commissioners who approved the rate hike
request without holding a public hearing first.

The three commissioners who voted in favor of the rate increase were
Chairwoman Sheila Lumpe and Commissioners Connie Murray and M. Dianne
Drainer.  Bonner and DePasco aren't trying to remove commissioners
Kelvin Simmons and Robert Schemenauer, who voted against the rate
increase.

FUTURE OF REGULATION
LOUISIANA
PSC elects new leadership

The Public Service Commission has elected Commissioner James M. Field
(R., District 2) as its new chairman, a commission staff member told
TR.  Commissioner Jack A. (Jay) Blossman Jr. (R., District 1) was
elected vice chairman.

Field joined the PSC Dec. 2, 1996, and his term ends Dec. 31, 2006.
Blossman became a commission member Jan. 1, 1997, and his term expires
Dec. 31, 2002.

MONTANA
House unanimously approves Uniform Electronic Transactions Act

The House has approved overwhelmingly a Uniform Electronic Transaction
Act to prohibit anyone from denying legal effect or enforceability to a
record or signature solely because it's in electronic form.  (1/19/01
a.m.)  Secretary of State Mike Cooney (D.) requested HB 234, which was
sponsored officially by Rep. Bob Lawson (R., District 80).

Each government agency would be able to determine whether and to what
extent it would send and accept electronic records and electronic
signatures.  Government agencies, however, wouldn't be limited to any
specific types of technologies.

HB 234 also states that electronic signatures would be valid only if all

agreed to conduct one transaction by electronic means, the party could
refuse to conduct other transactions electronically.  This right to opt
out of electronic transactions couldn't be waived.

HB 234 awaits consideration by the Senate Business and Labor Committee.

MONTANA
Lawmakers to examine price cap regulation

State lawmakers will be considering a bill to allow telecom carriers to
opt out of rate-of-return regulation if they accept price cap
regulation.  LC 655, which awaits introduction, states that a local
exchange carrier's (LEC's) election to accept price cap regulation would
be irrevocable.  Qwest Corp. proposed the bill's language, the
legislative staff told TR.  Sen. Fred Thomas (R., District 31) requested
the measure.

LB 655 would set a LEC's price caps at the permanent rates last
authorized by the Public Service Commission for the company before it
elected to come under the new regulatory structure.  The price floors
would be set at total-service long-run incremental cost.

The new prices set under the price cap regulation would be indefinite;
no specific time reference is included in the draft bill.  The PSC
wouldn't be able to change the price caps unless changes were needed to
reflect a new tax or fee.  The prices also could change to allow a LEC
to recover the additional cost of providing a new telecom service or the
expense of a new or expanded program, such as an extended area service
region.

Additionally, the prices could change if the LEC filed an application
with the PSC and justified a change in a price cap.  The commission
would have 60 days to act on the application.

If a complaint were filed by a consumer or consumer counsel regarding
the company's prices and the PSC found the company had violated the
provisions of this measure, the commission would have the authority to
order the LEC to comply with the measure.  The draft bill is available
at http://data.opi.state.mt.us/bills/2001/lchtml/LC0655.htm.

Bill aims to provide equal treatment for cable TV companies

Sen. Mary Lundby (R., District 26) has introduced SF 47 to require a
city granting more than one cable TV franchise to make the terms and
conditions of the additional franchise no more favorable and no less
burdensome than those of the existing franchise agreement.

Terms and conditions would include the territorial extent of the
franchise; system design; technical performance standards; construction
schedule; performance bonds; standards for construction and installation
of cable TV facilities; service to subscribers; public, government, and
educational access channels and programming; liability and
indemnification; and franchise fees.

If the terms or conditions of any additional franchise were more
favorable or less burdensome than the terms or conditions of any
existing cable TV franchise, the more favorable or less burdensome terms
or conditions also would apply for any existing cable TV franchise.

SF 47 has been referred to the Senate Commerce Committee.

ILLINOIS
ICC seeks extension of 10-digit dialing in Chicago area

The state Commerce Commission yesterday asked the FCC to extend a waiver
it granted to the commission to delay implementation of 10-digit dialing
in the Chicago metropolitan area until April 1.

On Jan. 17 North American Numbering Plan administrator (NANPA) NeuStar,
Inc., informed the ICC that the last NXX code in the ""847"" area code had
been assigned and that the first NXX code in the ""224"" ""overlay"" would
be assigned in 30 days.  Activation would occur 90 days thereafter.

Assuming that NANPA is correct, and that there are no NXX codes in the
847 NPA that should be returned, activation of the first code in the 225
NPA may occur on or after May 17, the ICC said..  It said its success
forestalling exhaustion of the five Chicago codes may cause the
temporary waiver to expire before activation of a single new NXX code in
the 224 overlay or any other Chicago area code.  (CC docket 96-98)

Bill targets drivers' use of handheld wireless phones

Rep. K. Mark Takai (D., District 34) has introduced HB 225 to make it
illegal to drive while talking on a handheld wireless phone.  Persons
convicted of using their wireless phones while driving would face a
maximum $100 fine for a first offense.  Violators could face a maximum
$200 fine for second offenses and a maximum $500 fine for any additional
offenses.

In addition to the fines, anyone caught violating the measure would be
required to attend a traffic safety class and pay a $50 driver
assessment fee.

HB 225 would provide exemptions for any drivers making ""911"" emergency
calls, reporting traffic accidents, or having a reason to fear for their
lives.  The bill awaits consideration by House Transportation Committee
and the House Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs Committee.

Bill calls on OCC to provide EAS for every exchange

Sen. Frank Shurden (D., District 8) has prefiled SB 151 to require the
Corporation Commission to expand the state's current wide area calling
(or extended area service) plans to include every local exchange in the
state.  The OCC would have to implement wide area calling plans that
correspond to the areas served by the ""405,"" ""580,"" and ""918"" number
planning areas.

The bill acknowledges that the OCC can implement the wide area numbering
plans only to the extent possible under federal law.

Bill would create nonprofit corporation to manage DTE info service

Sen. Linda J. Melconian (D., Hampden) has introduced SB 400 to create a
nonprofit corporation called Mass211, Inc., to administer the

Telecommunications and Energy.

Last year the DTE ordered the abbreviated dialing code ""211"" to be
assigned to the service.  The service will refer callers to agencies
that deal with domestic violence, substance abuse, elder services,
crisis intervention, health care, housing, food and fuel donations,
support groups, family counseling, and a range of other health and human
services.  (5/22/00 a.m.)

to be assessed against violators of the proposed anti-spamming law.  AB
1390 has been referred to the Committee on Consumer Affairs and
Protection; its text is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01390.

Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer (D., District 67) has introduced AB 1668

MISSOURI
PSC gives ALLTEL more time to comply with billing rules

The Public Service Commission has granted ALLTEL Missouri, Inc.'s
request for an extension until March 31 to comply with two new billing
rules.  The commission's order adopts an agreement reached by ALLTEL,
the commission staff, and the public counsel.

On Sept. 22, 2000, ALLTEL told the PSC it couldn't update fully its
billing program to accommodate the new rules until March 31 and asked
for an exemption until that time.  The billing rules went into effect at
the end of October 2000.

The agreement calls for ALLTEL to continue sending its traditional
notice of discontinuance until the company begins following a new rule
on ""discontinuance of service to residential customers.""  In addition,
the agreement requires ALLTEL to review manually each account for which
service is at risk of being disconnected until the company implements
the new billing rules.  The agreement also asked ALLTEL to continue
sending notices to customers who haven't paid their accounts.  The
notices must inform customers when they must pay to avoid losing
service.

The PSC's order is available at

? SoCal. Ed MOU Introduced as Bill
? House Committee Douses Emergency Energy Relief Act

MOU Has Its Day
Sources report that California Senator Polanco has introduced the legislation 
today for the MOU between the Governor and SoCal Edison (SB 78XX).  As 
reported earlier, sources still believe that there is not sufficient 
legislative support for this measure to pass.  Senator Polanco's political 
career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his 
MOU sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain 
support from Davis.  Additionally, the CPUC has added two necessary MOU 
provisions to its next week voting agenda, though support for these issues 
remains weak on the CPUC board.   

House Energy Relief Efforts
The House Energy and Commerce Committee gave up plans to ease California's 
energy woes because Republicans and Democrats could not settle a long 
standing debate over price caps in the West.  Representative Waxman admitted 
a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates, and 
several delayed mark-up sessions for the bill.  Barton noted the bill had 
little chance of aid California considering the time it would take to pass 
the bill would be longer than the California summer.

0,"Joe, Jeff an Bob:
Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections 
to our new form of Annex A:

1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply

2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff 
language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if 
they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity.

3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the ""or otherwise"" language in 
the setoff language.  Again, this is a credit issue.

4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting 
a master in place with them.  Sara expects this to happen in the next few 
days.

5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill.  I am working on this 
one and their attorney owes me a response.  This one may take a few weeks.

6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening 
letter.  It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial 
derivatives with them recently.

7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to 
tell me specifically what they object to.  I will continue to follow up with 
their attorney.

8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric.

9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying 
they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.  I will 
follow up with their attorney.

10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z) 
to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation 
as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.  Credit 
should be alerted.

11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A 
and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response.

12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy.

13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an 
ISDA with them.  If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have 
requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA 
negotiations.  I can prepare a mark-up.

Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12 carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries, but he?s a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.<BR>

Boston had eight catches for 84 yards on Saturday against the N.Y. Giants. Boston was held out of the end zone, but he's still one of the best Fantasy receivers in the game. <BR>

Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. <BR>

Williams was held to only 41 yards rushing on Sunday, but he did score his seventh touchdown of the year. Williams is a solid Fantasy tailback, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. <BR>

Green had a good outing against Oakland, posting 253 yards passing, two touchdowns and one interception. Green has thrown six more picks than touchdowns this season, however, so don?t depend on him too heavily during the Fantasy playoffs.<BR>

Jones scored a touchdown last week against Oakland, but he's still not seeing enough carries to warrant Fantasy consideration. Unless you're desperate and in a deeper league, there's no reason to risk starting Jones in Week 13. <BR>

Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points. <BR>

Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain on the active roster until Sunday. ""I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals,"" Wilkins said. ""It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no tweaks."" <BR>

I spoke w/Karry this morning on this issue and it appears as if this gas will 
be purchased by HPLC as wellhead.

I'm waiting for Karry to phone me back, after he's spoken w/Legal, before I 
give you a concrete answer.

Thanks

Jackie:

Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the HPL Liquids contract 
012-41970-02-002 in March 2000.  Also last month when you were out, Robert 
removed the volume from the Liquids contract at this meter and temporarily 
put it on a Strangers Gas contract.  If you could fix both months today and 
let me know when it is corrected  I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Fred

Jackie:

I am new at the 3 Rivers allocation so bear with me, I took this over from 
Anita Luong.  In January 2000, and going forward, please make sure that 
Meters 5688 and 5801 are not scheduled on the HPL Liquids contract 
012-41970-02-002.  The contract is currently out of balance by the total 
volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning 
I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Fred

I see that these were not forwarded to you, but that Kris Johnon claims to 
have already forwarded copies of the contracts to Enron's attorney, Do you 
have these contracts already?

What is your comfort level as to the nature of these documents and your 
personal time constraints to review and negotiate?  I've been working with 
Clark Thompson and Jay Sonnenberg at Bracewell and would be happy to help get 
them involved if you think it helpful or advisable.

Please let me know.

October 13, 2000

This past Wednesday eveing, the cocktail party in honor of the National
Audubon Society=01,s Living Ocean, held at the home of W. Graham Arader III=
 at
1016 Madison Avenue, was a stellar event, drawing a crowd and raising
awareness.  The focus of the event was the launching of the =01&Just Ask=01=
8
campaign, aimed at protecting the creatures of the sea by expanding consume=
r
awareness about food from the ocean.  Attendees sampled delicious recipes
from some of the top US chefs, all of whom used fish recommended by the
=01&Seafood Lover=01,s Almanac,=018 a beautifully designed, whimsical guide=
 to fish
and shellfish that serves to help consumers become more familiar with the
seafood they eat.
.
Edited by Ms. Mercedes Lee (with Suzanne Iudicello and Dr. Safina
contributing), the Seafood Lover=01,s Almanac provides readers with crucial
information regarding sea life: what is safe to eat, for example, and which
species are endangered.  Many seafoods commonly available today are much
less plentiful than the average consumer might think.  Consumers hold the
greatest influence over the buying decisions of seafood wholesalers and
retailers, and with the efforts of the National Audubon Society this issue
will have a much greater chance of receiving widespread attention.

America=01,s top seafood chefs (and their spectacular creations) were in
attendance, including Rick Moonen, of Oceana, New York; Todd English,
Kingfish Hall, Boston; Jonathan Eismann, Pacific Time, Miami; Robert
Kinkead, Kinkead=01,s, Washington, D.C.; and Terence Feury, Striped Bass,
Philadelphia.  The sampling of food ranged from Margarita Oysters to
Dungeness Crabcakes with Chipotle Vinaigrette, Sesame Seared Tuna with
seaweed salad, pickled ginger, wasabe and fried wontons, all served up in a=
n
irresistible fashion.  Best of all, the chefs generously shared their
recipes to all who whished to recreate these delicious appetizers at home.

Other notable guests included Jennifer Bogo, Associate Editor for The
Environment Magazine; Barbara Fairchild, Editor and Chief of Bon Appetite;
Mindy Fox of the Earth Pledge Foundation; Jennifer Herman of Martha Stewart
Magazine; Ray Isle, Senior Editor of Wine & Spirits; James Rodewald, Senior
Editor of Gourmet; and of course, Graham Arader, a long time supporter of
the Audubon Society, who would not have missed the event for the world.

The evening was permeated by celebration and enthusiasm for the new =01&Jus=
t
Ask=018 campaign: a wonderful sign that support for the Audubon Society and=
 all
of its fundamental projects continues to grow.  Please do not hesitate to
contact us if you would like information on how you can make a contribution
to the invaluable efforts of the National Audubon Society.

tomorrow at 2pm to discuss the Power Batch Modules and how pricing, volumes,

potential for large amounts of manual data entry of contracts during our

handling this on a periodic basis.

Vince,

Attached you will find a draft ""thought document"" based on our

recollections.  Please edit it to your liking and pass it back to me.  In
the next steps I have laid out a plan of action that should lead us to a

Let me emphasize that this is a working document so feel free to modify it
in whatever ways you think appropriate (don't be bashful--I want us to get
this right).

Have a great day.

Your friend,

Subject: Re: VEPCO/FYI  

Thanks.  I think we have alot of the same accounting issues here if the PPA 
is construed to be a lease.  If it is a lease, we have similar spending and 
EPC concerns as our other deals.  Do we know who the O&M contractor will be?  
If ENA or affiliate, we should not take on plant risk - just make sure our 
fair value O&M fee is the only amount at risk under the O&M agreement.  As of 
Friday, AA told us that even in a non-offtake situation, they may say we are 
in a lease if we take on plant risk through an O&M agreement.  This was new 
news to us.

Subject: VEPCO/FYI

I'm working with the commerial team on on PPA (and associated transactions) 
for Virginia Power.  The project involves the construction of  a peaker to 
supply some/most of the power, with the ability to supply from the market as 
well.  The plant has an 01 service date, so things are really picking up. 

Matt and Herman, this is the transaction we discussed with Heather a few 
weeks ago.

Items on the immediate to do list include:

Executing a land option agreement
Closing on the land (or assign to City of Rocky Mount, and let them close)
Selling/transferring the land to the City of Rocky Mount; negotiate long term 
lease
Negotiating a PILOT agreement (payment in lieu of taxes) with the City
Negotiating fuel supply agreements
Selecting/contracting with EPC contractor - can it be NEPCO?
Long lead equipment purchases (?) - could be home for LM 6000's, but other 
equipment may be needed
Negotiate interconnection agreement

This deal is showing a lot of life, so I thought it might be helpful to give 
you a heads up.

Don,

There is no question you are right - this can happen.  You also know in
trading there is no transaction without risk (especially in NY).  Do you
trust the ISO and their software to effectively implement a whole new
settlement?  You may also be aware of some of the gaming opportunities that
arose when they looked into implementing the BME settlement.  The proposed
solution seems to eliminate most of the gaming, and yes, shifts more risk
over to the market participant.  Sometimes we have to take the bad with the
fair.  The 20k adder didn't fix anything - it only gave DAM transactions a
higher priority - if you want that security it is still open to you.  All
this does is give you the option to have the ISO evaluate your transaction
again the real-time . . . like any option, you don't have to exercise it.


Good luck,

El Paso subsidiary Colorado Interstate Gas is dusting off its Ruby Pipeline project in light of the scramble to increase deliveries to the California market. The project, which originally was announced in 1998 to serve northern Nevada, will be extended to Reno, NV, and into California, the pipeline said in an open season announcement. 
""In response to increased demand for gas supply in northern Nevada and northern California markets, Colorado Interstate Gas Co. (CIG) is announcing an open season to evaluate constructing interstate gas transmission capacity from the Rockies to these markets,"" the announcement states. ""Natural gas production from the Rocky Mountain supply basins is projected to increase dramatically over the next few years and the Ruby Pipeline Project (Ruby) will provide access to these supplies."" 
CIG said it has been working with shippers interested in developing an 850-mile 30- and 36-inch diameter pipeline running from western Wyoming through Elko, NV, Reno, Yuba City, CA, and ending in Sacramento, CA. CIG also anticipates interconnecting in Northern California with Wild Goose Storage, which is currently holding its own open season to evaluate expanding its facility. Ruby will be capable of providing up to 750 MDth per day of incremental transportation capacity to these areas. It is anticipated to be in service in late 2003. 
Parties interested in obtaining transportation service to delivery points in northern Nevada and Northern California are invited to submit bids in this open season, which started on April 23 and will close on May 31. Questions concerning the open season should be directed to Craig Coombs at (719) 520-4387; Ed Miller (719) 520-4305; or Tom Dobson (719) 520-4606.

0,"Bruce, is it OK if I notice Hellmold's deposition on 6/13-14 for your
offices??

By now you should see that Mr. Hellmold's second report is a 50-page
single-spaced document consisting primarily of argument of plaintiff's entire
case and written obviously by MacLeod, not Hellmold.  MacLeod told me last
night that, by virtue of the length and breadth of this second report, MacLeod
expects the two of you, in addition to me, to have extensive questions, that
he does not intend to argue that you ""finished"" your questions in the first
two-day session of Hellmold's deposition, and that he expects Hellmold's
deposition to take up all or substantially all of 6/14 as well as 6/13.

We should probably talk live among the three of us about coordinating our
approach to this deposition.  By the way, I have it on very good authority
that Hellmold fears Frank and is not relishing the prospect of further
questions from him.   (I can fill you in.)

Each quarter I will evaluate the classes (mainly attendance) to see how well 
they are performing.  Then I will be able to make adjustments to the schedule 
accordingly.  Our goal is to get people to try new things and not just go 
back to what they did before.  We have spent a lot of time and money getting 
brand new weights, spinning bikes and cardio equipment in here and want you 
all to have a chance to try it out.  Just give this schedule a try for a 
while when we open and keep me posted with your feedback.  Thanks!

Subject: Re: Body Shop Group Exercise Schedule  

Ann, do you think if there is not as many people participating in the 
spinning classes at lunch, you would offer additional spinning classes in the 
evening?  I noticed there is a spinning class offered every day at lunch but 
only one class offered in the evening.   There  are numerous people who were 
hoping to enjoy spinning two times a week but due to our work environment we 
are only able to work out in the evenings, period.     In addition,  we were 
hoping to do Bootcamp the other two remaining evenings, which looks like 
right now it is only offered on Monday and previously it was offered both 
Monday and  Wednesday.   

Is it possible that  if you do not have very much participation for the 
""total body conditioning class""  on Tuesday & Thursday you could replace it 
with another spin class and another bootcamp class.    Or maybe the ""total 
body conditioning class"" could be moved to  Monday and Wednesday and then it 
would free up the studio to have Bootcamp on Tuesday & Thrusday.   Then if 
you hopefully add another spin class you could insert it on Monday so you 
would be offering an evening spin class both Monday and Wednesday.   That 
would be wonderful.    

Also do you think before the spin class (s) in the evening  an ""ab lab"" class 
could be added before the beginning of class like at 5:30 pm?   

Any feedback you have would be great.   For a lot of us who have to work-out 
in the evenings only we hoping to be able to at least do a spin class  
acouple of times and then a boot camp a couple of times.     If  there is 
enough particiaption for this do you know how long it will take to get set 
up?   

Thank you for all of you help, comments or suggestons.

Subject: TW Laguna Station Remediation

On Wednesday, October 20th, I contacted Ms. Barbara Bernacik at the Office of 
the Pueblo of Laguna, Division of Environment. I contacted Ms. Bernacik at 
the suggestion of Norm Gonzales (TW Laguna Team) to discuss outstanding 
environmental issues at the Station. 

In a conversation with Norm the previous week, Norm indicated to me that he 
had met with Ms. Bernacik and Ray Lucero (Engineer, Pueblo of Laguna) 
recently in regards to backfilling an open excavation which had been 
excavated in 1993 when a diesel UST was removed from the site. The excavation 
had not been backfilled pending authorization from the Pueblo of Laguna. This 
and other outstanding issues were discussed in a meeting with Ray Lucero, the 
Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, Ted Ryther, Larry Campbell, Butch Russell, 
and myself back in 1995 but there was no resolution of the issues, primarily 
because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person 
to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's 
environmental staff person about two years ago. 

In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. 
Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept 
apprised of environmental issues at the Station. In light of this, I have 
prepared a ""Report of Groundwater Monitoring Activities"". This report covers 
monitoring activities between June 1994 and June 1999. As previously 
mentioned, I also contacted Ms. Bernacik for the purpose of introducing 
myself and to inform her that a report has been prepared and will be 
delivered to her office. I also suggested that we meet at the site to discuss 
outstanding environmental issues. The response from Ms. Bernacik was very 
favorable and we agreed to meet at the site at 10:00 am November 16th. Ms. 
Bernacik also indicated that someone from the BIA will be with her.

		 Subject: QUANTIFICATION OF BENEFITS OF OPEN ACCESS ON ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION 
NETWORK

In discussions with the Administration, it has become clear that there would 
be great political value in being able to  demonstrate (a) the economic value 
of open access for the US and (b) the impact open access would have on the 
current energy crisis.

Enron has developed historical analysis of the impact of deregulation on 
natural gas.  Margaret Carson is putting together some slides that show (1) 
throughput improvements, (2) expansion in pipeline capacity, and (3) cost 
reductions in the industry.  While not exactly identical, there are some good 
reasons to assume that the same would occur in the electricity industry.

It would be great if you could develop a general qualitative framework that 
would outline why open access is preferable in the very short-term and work 
on a larger quantitative framework over the medium-term.

To that end, Richard Tabors of TCA had earlier analyzed the economic loss 
from AEP's abuse of its transmission network last year.  He may have 
additional insights into developing this concept.

Please call me with further questions at 713-853-7673.

I am an analyst with Metals Origination in London and got your name from 
David Oliver.  Enron Metals is in the process of dealing with White Pine 
Copper Refinery in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  One of the options we 
are reviewing is returning a dormant generator to operation and selling the 
excess power.  Natural gas is delivered to White Pine through an Enron 
pipeline.  The generator can run on either natural gas or coal.  Several 
years ago ('96 or '97), Enron contacted White Pine (previously owned by BHP 
Copper White Pine Refinery) on numerous occasions about running the 
powerhouse on gas and they would get the excess power to market.  The idea at 
the time was they had excess natural gas and wanted White Pine to run the 
generators on gas.  Would you know anything about this deal or who the 
originator was?  If so, could you or the originator please contact me 
regarding the details.  If not, could you please direct me to someone who may 
know about the original proposal?

Regards,

What a great surprise!  

Life is pretty good.  To see a summary, you might want to check out Paige's 
website: http://www.southwestern.edu/~recordp/  (I tried to copy that as a 
link, but I think I messed up.)

I guess Peggy told you (or you figured out from my email address) that I'm 
working at Enron. I like it.  I enjoy being back downtown after being a 
suburban lawyer.  Home life is relatively calm, which has always been a goal 
of mine.  I'm dealing with my folks getting older, with the health problems 
which come with that process.  Overall, I'm very blessed and happy.

How about you?  If you are spending time at HM, you must still be doing the 
law thing. I might have lost a bet on that one.  So how's your life?  

Paige completed her minor in German.  Consider it a Wunder legacy!  Her 
brother, Michael is a real charmer.  You would get a huge kick out of him.

Thanks so much for writing.  I can't wait to hear what is going on with you.

Kevin Hannon is the executive lead for Cornell and he needs to approve.   I

reserving the Super Saturday weekend for individuals that are highly likely

Although they are responsible for Graduate recruiting at Cornell, perhaps it

Hello everyone,

After much research and some delay, I have the info that I think will work
well for Mom and Dad.  I tried to combine a NICE cruise (good food,
accommodation, itinerary) with cost.

Here's what I have come up with:

Princess Cruises
Dawn Princess (ship), July 17 departure, 7 night cruise
Vancouver-Inside passage-Ketchikan-Juneau-Skagway-Glacier Bay-College Fjord
crossing-Seward(Anchorage)
Outside room with balcony
$2555.45/per person

I also think that they should spend a day in Vancouver before the cruise.
That adds $258/night (I think they should stay 2 nights--they fly up
Saturday, have Saturday night and Sunday, board the ship on Monday).  The
somewhat high price is because they stay at either the Four Seasons or Sutton
Place.

The total is $6026 or $1506 for each of us (if I did the math right--check
it).  This price includes airfare, port charges, all food etc on board. It
doesn't include alcohol or sodas on board, any excursions taken in port
(sightseeing tours), tips for cabin steward, waiter and busboy (about $200
for the trip). So we could also throw in a few hundred dollars of mad money.

This price ($2555.45 per person with the hotel in Vancouver) is really
great--they are doing some kind of special.  Holland America is much more and
a comparable cruise with no balcony is $2440).

I have a reservation for them which is good until Monday.  There is a $500
deposit required with the balance due 60 days before departure.

Let me know what you think--comments, etc.

0,"Dear Jerry:
First let me say that I am excited about having your family 92.5 Acres for
sale.
It is a good combination place and I feel there is a good market for it.

The mixture of woods, pasture, creek and home with a very private setting
are
some of the features that will have a great deal of appeal in today's
market.

I have completed the market analysis on the property and based on the
comparison of sales and asking prices of comparable properties and business
conditions in general at this time I  feel the market is indicating a
probable
sale price of $170,000 which figures out at about $1,300 per acre for the
land
and timber and the remaining $49,750 for the home and other improvements.

I have made an itemized estimate in the remarks section of the listing
agreement
of typical seller's closing costs for your review.

After you have had an opportunity to look over the agreement and talk with
your
brothers give me a call to answer any question you may have.

If the three of you feel you would like to begin marketing at a somewhat
higher
price and see what the market will bear we can do that. I have learned a
long time
ago that I can never say exactly what a place will or will not sell for. All
said and
done,  what a property will sell for is what a buyer is willing to give.

Our marketing efforts will expose your property to a good number of
qualified
buyers who are ready and able to buy, many of them for all cash.

Chris gave me his email address and I am send a copy of this letter and
attachments
to him also.

I do not have an email address for Don. You can forward on a copy to him.

Here is a brief outline of what you need to do before sending the papers
back to me.


1. Decide on the listing price and enter it in paragraph no. 1
2. Sign and return a copy of the ""Information about Brokerage
      Services Form""
       3.   To the best of your ability complete the three page form called
      ""Seller's Disclosure Notice"". This is a form that discloses any
      information a buyer should be told about the  home on property.
      Initial the bottom of the first two pages and sign the last page.
4. For your convenience each of you can sign a separate listing
      agreement and Agency Relationship form and return them.
5. When returning these form we need the originally signed copy
      so return them in regular mail.
6. Please remember to include a key to the house and barn and
      give me the gate lock combination.

Call me if you have a question and I will be looking forward to hearing from
you soon.

We are already in the process of selecting prospects from our files that we
feel will
interested in your property.

Yours truly,
JoEd Anderson

Mike,

Can you join us on Wednesday morning, November 15 to play golf at Canyon 
Springs golf course in San Antonio prior to the Enron Management Conference? 
Canyon Springs will allow us to book a 10:00am tee time thirty days in 
advance. Once I have confirmed the tee time I will forward directions to the 
course. Should be a fun group. Might even need a practice round at Champions 
prior to the trip.

0,"Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the 
mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale 
businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around 
mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test 
- i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of 
transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  
Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of 
explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does 
happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we 
believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where 
operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. 

These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which 
Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely 
designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to 
produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and 
potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that 
are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage 
success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class 
practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep 
review process would follow this set of steps:

 1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This 
is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be 
notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain 
that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 

 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell 
them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in 
making information and personnel available to complete the review.  

 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key 
commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and 
key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The 
deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process 
and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  

 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of 
the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those 
which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested.  
This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually 
very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support 
their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an 
additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with 
this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support 
the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office 
know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing 
so. 

 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be 
reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls 
and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, 
assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate 
personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume 
responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and 
to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey 
to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, 
doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep 
findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep 
teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each 
doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me 
sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick 
before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular 
concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more 
timely manner than quarterly.   

Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in 
Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors 
in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not 
concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the 
integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were 
discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's 
practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley 
was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted 
Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was 
for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  

Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from 
Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the 
case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I 
know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you 
would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when 
they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as 
a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in 
this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert 
them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the 
level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing 
directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and 
myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the 
download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice 
mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a 
meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona 
mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked 
for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the 
integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control 
which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  

To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the 
heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is 
to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to 
offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire 
Enron organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The 
findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, 
which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to 
""over-wordsmith"" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be 
surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can 
reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical 
perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  

I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with 
you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as 
valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain 
members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other 
businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any 
suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process."

0,"In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of 
people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that 
team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that 
perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic 
has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team 
and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy 
Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through 
CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the 
facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in 
conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior 
Director
 CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

 User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power 
Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

 NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
 ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, 
were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked 
in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles 
where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing 
both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the 
operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the 
past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project 
managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations 
experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most 
appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie 
on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very 
quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a 
scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over 
natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since 
Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was 
already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the 
project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to 
EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, 
who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom 
looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently 
renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange 
project team, and we transfered her along with the project to 
CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements 
work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is 
input from my group that has created the modules by defining user 
requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  
I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's 
participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a 
senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development 
background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was 
the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on 
CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her 
involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to 
CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is 
excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable 
operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie 
Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from 
day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging 
products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and 
both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and 
back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their 
replacements on CommodityLogic.

Susan,

We are getting very close to the start up of the Bazor Ridge plant.. When I
talked to you Friday, you were going to request that Stacy ""generate the
paper"".  Has this been done yet?  The invoicing does not appear to be an
issue any more, our controller would like us to invoice Enron and Rebel to
invoice EOTT on all products.  Also, I am assuming that you changed the
September pricing to Gas Daily, as you implied below, on August 25.  Right
now we are looking at a start up on the last 10 days or so of September.

If there are problems with any of the above, please call me a soon as you
can today at (601)969-1568.  I will be out the rest of the week.  If
anything comes up after today please contact Dan Cole at the same number.

Thank you,

Stevens

Stevens-

I've been trying to get in touch with our attorney Stacy Dickson to see if
the confirmation is signed.  The last version of the confirmation reflected
gas daily pricing for August and index pricing for Sept, Oct and Nov.  I
think we will need to amend this if the time periods are going to be
different.

I'll let you know when I hear back from Stacy.

Susan,

As I understand it (which could be dangerous), if it comes on in 1st, 2nd
week of September we have to use Gas Daily, is this correct?  Our comtract
calls for the time period to be 3 months, after the 1st day following the
first month of production.  This would carry the contract through,
December.

Also, the operator of Destin pipeline is still telling the operator of the
well that Enron does not have a shipping agreement in place.  I have told
them that Enon is telling us they are ready to recieve.

expect to have residue gas for sale between 9/2 and 9/6, depending on how

"
0,"Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully ""regulate"" prices in the secondary market.)
 
Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.  
 
But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.  
 
That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?
 
Best,
Jeff

Enron has an interest in the U.S. and internationally patented Angle Master. 
We now have marketing prototypes made, patents in place, outstanding consumer 
interest and are ready to proceed to the 
next step. 
The Angle Master can be very large or  small.. The output gear smoothly 
transitions from 0-90 degrees at high torque to 
to reach or drill any angle. The input gear can be driven by any device. No 
product on the market can perform 
like the Angle Master. I can see the use of the Angle Master for various 
drilling applications, including horizontal drilling 
Professional mechanics in all fields who have seen the smaller Angle Master 
all want one. We have endorsements from professional 
drivers, mechanics, and many others. 
A recently retired Captain of a nuclear aircraft carrier has stated in a 
letter ""....The use of the Angle Master.... will 
result in a significant time savings which in turn will increase combat 
readiness of aircraft and ships due to the more rapid 
turnaround of out of commission systems. Every mechanic will want the Angle 
Master in their toolbox after they have seen it in 
operation."" 
A Senior Vice President of Operations for a major Aerospace Company has 
stated in writing "" .... Prototype manufacturing, 
tool manufacturing, assembly, repair and overhaul operations will all benefit 
from the flexibility of the Angle Master.""

0,"Vince,
I just spoke with Rakesh.  I believe that there is some confusion regarding which part of that Raptor transaction we are talking about.  There are actually two different sets of forwards: one for up to 18MM shares contingently based on price as an offset to the Whitewing forward shortfall, and the other was for 12MM shares which was more of a straight restricted forward contract on ENE shares.  We all went over the valuations on both sets of forwards pretty thoroughly back in March, and I'm certain that the valuations that were put together included the contingent nature of the forwards on the 18MM shares.  In fact, I believe that we had a meeting with a couple of managers from Arthur Andersen to discuss the general methodology.  Of course, the valuations on the 12MM shares had no such component.  Let me know if you have more questions or concerns.  Thanks Vince.

Ron,

Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result
in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going
into the Raptor vehicles.

We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project. 
We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model.
This omission makes our valuation more conservative

TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS

Per my other e-mail... we are on target in getting the total gas withdrawn

additional storage gas out of the ground. If you do outside deals, this just

The lenders have specifically asked for an original of the Letter Agreement.
If it is really problematic to get another 2 copies signed, I can ask them
again if they will accept a copy.  I appreciate that there are only 2
parties to the document, but the lenders' reasoning is that the Letter
Agreement is a key underlying document and as such, they would expect to
have an original.  Also, our original arrangement was that we would sign 6
originals of each relevant document so that all parties could have
originals.

I know what a pain it is to get documents re-executed and I apologize that
this request has come so late in the day.

Regards
Isabel

Isabel:

ENA signed two originals of the Letter Agreement (as the Letter Agreement
has only two parties).  I kept one for ENA and provided the other to Greg
Lang for PPL by letter dated May 2, 2001.  I still do not have an original
of PPL's signature, but Greg Lang did provide a fax copy.    Is it necessary
for the parties to sign additional copies for non-parties?   I am checking
with ENA on the GE documents.  Thanks.

		 Subject: FW: CAISO Notice - Draft Market Stabilization Plan


Greetings:
Late last night the ISO released a Market Stabilization plan that would
essentially impose cost based pricing control caps and apply a strict
California First Policy.

Here's ISO's 3-page sketch to impose cost-based pricing intended to control
costs on consumers on very short order.  Unit-specific cost-based bid caps
will apply to ISO markets.  ISO will have dispatch control over all CA
generation.  Capital costs and return appear to be excluded from the bid
caps.  ISO will pick of the day-ahead and day-of energy markets lot to the
demise of CalPX, thus ending the ""market separation.""  There appears to be
language that intimates direct unit dispatch, but the document is very thin
on this. ISO proposes payments based either on the ""as-bid"" up to unit bid
cap, or apparently a uniform market-clearing price based on marginal units
cap.  Out of state resources are paid California capped rates.  Settlement
will be on numbers other than those posted (so much for transparency).
There's looking to procure AS based on optimization, although this is not
spelled out well (it appears that self-provision is gummed up completely).

To prevent ""MW Laundering"" CA will required in-area generation to make all
capacity
available whenever Stage 1 or higher emergency (i.e., reserves below 7%).
This California
First! rule means the generation must be scheduled against CA loads or bid
into day-ahead
market.  If you don't bid your bid cap is applied.  There will be a capacity
element
similar to RMR.  This change will require FERC buy-in, which obviously will
be
litigation-central, and its likely to create a cascade of similar
requirements from other
states ...

Thanks Andy for the quick summary!

IEP will monitor the Friday call and review all documents to let people know
what is happening.

Further to my message of yesterday evening, I have spoken with the MSCS 
lawyer in London and learned that EnronCredit.com Limited (""ECCL"") has 
finalized its ISDA Master Agreement and CSA with MSCS.  ECCL is awaiting the 
ENE guaranty.  The lawyer is forwarding docs to me this morning and I 
understand they were heavily negotiated.

 Tanya, will you be handling credit for both ENA and ENE?  I would like to

you both when I receive.

Thanks.  Sara

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building."

Sara,
Sorry, I was too assiduous in deleting what I thought would be duplicated on 
this thread, so I'm working from memory on comments before Guenther's last 
contribution.

Data for pricing is owned by Enron Credit Ltd (generated by employees of 
Enron Power Operations Ltd whose costs are charged to ECL)
Information deals are done with ECL (Derivative transactions are currently 
with Enron North America Corp, probably with Enron Credit Inc in the future)
The Enron staff who would be looking at this are employed by Enron North 
America Corp which is why I suggested ENAC as the named party.
They clearly act for ECL on information deals.
If it's OK to use ECL then that would be easier for us.

I have no objections to suggestions that I should be promoted! In the 
meantime, I am a board director of ECL and have both legal and group 
management authority to sign contracts (with a lawyer's initials being a 
prerequisite).

Regards,
Richard

Thanks for the response.  I'll wait to hear from Richard Sage as to who owns 
the information.
Only officers at the VP level or higher may execute binding contracts for all 
Enron U.S. companies (bylaws).  I do not know the ""rule"" for non-U.S. 
companies (although I suspect the articles of association would contain that 
information).

Sara

You are right about the tax issue - in fact, we are in the process of 
replacing the UK directors and officers of Enron Credit Inc with US directors 
and officers.

The entity that signs up to the confidentiality agreement ought to be the one 
that owns the information to be supplied.  Based on conversations I have had 
with Richard Sage, I had formed the impression that the owner of the 
information was Enron Credit Ltd.  If this is right, we should pursue your 
first suggestion.  Otherwise, given that the tax issue is being rectified and 
this should therefore be an isolated incident, I think we can wear the tax 
risk inherent in your second suggestion.  Though I do wonder whether an 
officer of Enron Credit Inc, such as Richard Sage (currently), could sign, 
rather than a director?

Kind regards

Guenther Klar

> and conference call.  On that basis, please find below the following
> advice on the following issues:
> 1. Legal and Privacy Statement.
> We believe that the Legal and Privacy statement should be available on the

> pages in the same form and style as the other navigational links.
> The Legal and Privacy statement contains important legal protections for
> Enron that we think should be displayed at the earliest opportunity and in
> a prominent fashion.  The more prominent the display, the easier it will
> be for Enron to argue that a user of the website was aware of this
> statement and therefore that it is binding on them.
> 2. Bid Box
> When a trader clicks on a bid or offer price in the trading section of the
> website a bid box appears.  It is important that this box contains wording
> that indicates that at the underlying legal level the trader is making an
> offer that Enron is free to accept or reject.  On that basis, we recommend
> that the main wording in the bid box be ""I want to buy [quantity]"" or ""I
> want to sell [quantity]"".
> 3. Availability of PA and ETA
> There is little case law to guide us as to the best approach for ensuring
> that agreements formed online are sufficiently executed to be enforced by
> courts in England.  To improve Enron's argument that the ETA has been
> sufficiently executed and agreed to by the counterparty, we advise that
> the ETA be available for viewing and printing at all times through a
> hotlink in the trading section of the website. This will assist our
> argument that the ETA is incorporated by reference when a counterparty
> signs the PA.  If, for some reason, (for example, the ETA is not available
> at the time of signing the PA), the direct incorporation of the ETA
> argument fails, the hotlink to the ETA may help to establish a course of
> dealing argument.  That is an argument that over time the counterparty has
> been trading on the same terms and conditions for each trade and has,
> therefore, affirmed its initial acceptance of those terms and conditions.
> 4. Registration Forms
> We look forward to an opportunity to review the online registration form
> for new customers.  We also look forward to reviewing the online
> registration form for view only users of the website.  Prior to our review
> of the view only registration form, can you please confirm whether or not
> Enron will be vetting view only applications.  If view only users are
> issued passwords automatically, without a confirmation of identity or
> other verification or clearance by Enron, then we should discuss the
> possible risks and legal issues that may arise.
> 5. Master Agreements
> We understand that Enron is internally discussing the relationship between
> Master Agreement, NBP terms and NBP side letters.  The conclusion of these
> discussion may require an amendment to the ETA, in particular clause 3(a).
> 6. Changes to the GTCs and ETA
> It is clear from an English law perspective and the bulk of overseas
> jurisdictions consulted by us that an change to the GTCs or ETA will
> require the counterparty to accept the change by executing a new version
> of the agreement.  Three issues have arisen in implementing this process:
> (a) Marking up Changes:  From a legal as well as a public relations
> perspective it is preferable that amended agreements contain a process for
> indicating what changes have been made.  This process could take the form
> of a list of changes or double underline or other mark-up procedure.
> Changes should be indicated against the previous version. All versions
> should be dated.  Similarly, the ticker tape screen should indicate that
> there is a new version until that new version is accepted.
> That said, this position is advisable only if Enron can be certain that
> all changes to amended agreements are identified.  If amended agreements
> are presented for execution that are improperly marked-up or do not
> mark-up certain changes, then Enron would have a lesser chance of
> enforcing these unmarked changes than if no marking-up was shown.
> Therefore, this process is advisable only if Enron can ensure that all
> changes are identified.
> (b) Notice of changes: We have previously discussed with you what
> procedure should be adopted by Enron to notify counterparties of the
> change in the ETA or GTCs.  To improve any argument that a counterparty
> has freely consented to an amended agreement, we would advise that Enron
> adopt a procedure for notifying counterparties of the altered agreements
> in advance of them taking effect.  This notice should not be a contractual
> obligation, rather an internal Enron procedure.  That said, we understand
> from our meeting that there may be emergency situations requiring an
> immediate change to an agreement, with the result that trading is
> suspended under the old agreement.  If those circumstances are likely to
> be the bulk of cases when amendments are to be made, then the notice
> process may not necessarily be appropriate.  If notice is not given, then
> Enron would be relying on the following elements as asserting that a
> counterparty freely accepted the amended agreement:
> (i) that the counterparty was prompted that the agreement had been amended
> (and if mark-ups are provided, that the changes were indicated); and
> (ii) that the counterparty is a professional organisation with experience
> in the speed and pace of the commodities trading industry.
> These elements are not conclusive but would give Enron an argument that
> the counterparty is bound to any accepted amended agreement.
> (c) Overseas Counsel: Advice from overseas counsel on amendment of the ETA
> and GTCs did not specify that Enron would not be giving the counterparty a
> period of notice of changes to the agreements, during which the
> counterparty could continue to trade.  Therefore, if it is ultimately
> decided that no notice period will be used, then we may need to seek
> further advice from overseas counsel.
> 7. ETA Termination
> Under your recent instructions we have amended the ETA so that it can only
> be terminated for convenience by Enron.  That is, there is no express
> termination for convenience right for a counterparty.  We have previously
> noted that this means that an ETA may continue to be in force with a

> Enron.  Advice from overseas counsel on the drafting of the ETA and GTCs
> was sought based on a reciprocal right to terminate with notice. We will

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.

Jeff,

Let me know what you think of this guy.  Wade Cline and Tim Det. are both 
high on him.  Jeff Donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on Friday.  
During my lunch with Jeff, we discussed that we need a Corp. Dev guy 
dedicated to us full time but if he reported to him, that would be great.  I 
think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get 
a part time guy in the process.  He could also report to us obviously (like 
Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a  lot of sense.  What do 
you think?

If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp 
Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.  I thought he was all 
right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an 
innovative thinker.  He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't 
seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus.  

Mike

0,"The attached document was transcribed by Maureen McVicker (per Steve's 
request).  It is a summary of Ken's conversation with Speaker Hertzberg last 
evening about the state of California's energy crisis. 

In terms of Ken's meetings in CA next week, a list of individuals that Ken 
will meet with has been finalized.  Ken's office is in the process of 
scheduling those meetings and as soon as the meetings are confirmed I will 
provide everyone with the complete schedule.  

Jeff Dasovich is the point person for pulling together the materials for 
Ken's briefing book, and for coordinating the meeting schedule with Rosalee.  
A prebriefing will take place in Houston between Ken, Steve and Jeff early 
next week.   

If you have any questions about Ken's tour through CA next week, please 
contact Jeff Dasovich directly.

news?  Enron, cited as the Most Innovative Company in America for five years 
in a row, prints a newsletter every two months.  We could reorganize entire

Don't worry.  Our printed newsletter isn't going anywhere; it's still the 
best way to bring you detailed accounts of Enron's long-term business 
direction and achievements.  

Let's just say that print has a new friend.  And -- you guessed it -- that 
friend is the dot.  As in ""dot.com""; as in you now have an online connection 
for fast-breaking news about and around Enron.  It's called eBiz, and it will 
change the way you get news.  It might even change the way you think about 
news.  

eBiz will come racing across the Enron intranet on home.enron.com every two 
weeks, and we will post breaking news and announcements as they happen.  The 
news in eBiz will be so fresh and timely and fun to read, you may have to

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me

Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike

Here are 6 attachments.? In order of appearance they are

1.? (04)???????????????? Master Netting Agreement
2.? (USCUSTST)??? The Terms of Business Agreement (TOB)
3.? (20)???????????????? LME Guide
4.? (21)???????????????? LME Guidance Letter
5.? (22)?????????????????LME Guidance Letter
6.? (23)??????????????? Payment and Settlement Instructions


The TOB is the standard trading agreement and is the most important.? The
Master Netting Agreement simply
avoids the country by country and state by state possibility of cherry
picking in a default/bankruptcy event. The
3 Guidance letters are LME requirements. Payments are self explanatory.

Again, I think the TOB is a simple document and applies to regular exchange
cleared LME client business.? Not only is it simpler and applicable for this
transaction, but also the regular cleared contracts which are invloved, fall
into PART 30? Exemption of the CFTC. This exemption requires Sogemin to
protect 100% of any resulting client profits by means of an updated bond

I hope this TOB method helps expidite our business. We very much look

Remember to join Enron Global Services Chairman & CEO Stan Horton on an eSpeak session Thursday, October 18 at 10 a.m. Houston time where he will answer questions regarding the new EGS. This is a great opportunity to get first hand information about what's going on within EGS and throughout Enron. 

If you can't make the live event, don't sweat it.  Go to http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp, and submit your question(s) today.  Stan will try to answer your questions during his ""open mike"" session, and you can read the transcript whenever you get the opportunity. 

Don't miss this opportunity to hear it straight from the top."
0,"Hi Patrice,

I have an issue with Edison Mission and I saw your name on a deal (1094593) from October so I thought I could ask you about it. It looks like the deals are on a month to month basis. They paid us $5M back in February and each month we deduct their invoice from this balance. They called Max in Credit (x.58261) and want their money back. So, I am fully prepared to wire them their money back, I just want to make sure all the people involved are aware. Credit is going to request an invoice from them stating what we owe them. When that comes in someone in credit will sign off on this request. I just want to make the front-end aware of what's going on. Do you know who else does these deals? Thanks for your help

Have a GREAT Thanksgiving.....you may already be gone......if so, lucky you!!!!

    Let me review where we stand for the April 10-11 meeting.
1.  I have spoken with Gavyn and asked him to add to his usual review 
comments on the significance of recent developments for Enron.
2.  I have asked Bill Kristol to do the same.
3.  I have asked Paul Portney to review ""the lay of the land"" in the 
environmental policy area.
4.  Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, 
now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the 
best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief 
talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on 
this subject.
5.  I couldn't get anyone on the ""monopoly-too-big-and-powerful"" question, 
although I am still trying.
I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply 
picture. Have we heard from the author of ""When Genius Fails""?

BRUSSELS, Aug. 21, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The European uncoated woodfree market remains quiet as the vacation period continues. But output curtailments have hit the headlines, as uncoated and coated woodfree producers kept taking downtime in the region during the second quarter.
Demand has not been anything to write home about this year, but the slack trend has been made worse by the mid-year vacation period when many offices are empty and order books thin. On top of the pressure to lower prices due to the lack of demand, suppliers have been faced with speculative buyers who are betting on uncoated woodfree paper prices falling further. As a result, buyers have been confining their purchases to minimum levels, replenishing stocks only when they need to.
Imports have perked up as those papermakers who have not been idling their machines have tried to find alternative markets for their products. One producer said large volumes of uncoated woodfree paper has been imported to Europe, especially from southeast Asia. Another supplier indicated that some Australian paper has found its way to the UK. 
Southern European papermakers have also reportedly been actively exporting to the Italian market. According to sources in Spain, the Spanish uncoated woodfree market is saturated due to overcapacity in the Iberian peninsula. 
Prices under pressure
The slack demand has pushed prices down in Europe over the vacation period, despite the heavy downtime taken. In the French market, prices for offset reels and sheets dropped by FF 100/tonne in June and by a further FF 100-300/tonne in July. One supplier said that business almost ground to a halt in July and that hefty discounts were available even on small orders. 
Germany has not escaped the price plunge either, with levels for offset sheets dropping DM 50/tonne at the top end of the range in June and DM 50/tonne at the bottom of the price band in July. Prices for offset reels dipped DM 100/tonne at the lower end in July. 
Italian levels for offset sheets and reels remained steady in June, but eroded by ITL 50/kg in July, while in the UK, both offset sheets and reels slid by Pounds 10/tonne in June and a further Pounds 10-20/tonne in July.
Cut-size crumbles
Copy paper managed to escape the price pressure on other uncoated woodfree grades for much of this year. But since June there have been signs that A4 is fallible, with levels starting to erode in almost all the major markets. 
Several players complained that Italy and Spain have been difficult markets, as some domestic producers have been running their machines flat out and selling as much as they can at low prices, benefiting from cheap spot pulp levels. Some suppliers to the Italian market said that the country's merchants have been aggressively trying to negotiate lower prices. 
Copy paper prices have slid by ITL 150/kg since April, and there have been reports of spot prices selling at ITL 200/kg below the market level. But one supplier was hopeful that the bottom has been reached and intends to try and raise prices by ITL 50/kg in September.
Cut-size levels remained steady in Germany. But in France, A4 prices have started to erode. Levels fell by FF 100/tonne at the bottom of the range in June and by another FF 100/tonne in July. 
In the UK, several industry insiders noted that the copy paper market has become more aggressive. Some suppliers reported that levels have been gradually eroding for the past couple of months, but others said they have not lowered their prices. On top of that, A4 from outside Europe, for example, from southeast Asia, is reportedly selling at up to Pounds 50/tonne below market levels.
But the outlook for the uncoated woodfree market is more positive for the rest of the year. Suppliers indicated that order books already look healthy for September, when activity traditionally perks up.

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Subject: Updated EOL Customer profiles

Frank:

We have recently rethought our treatment of some of our Western 
counterparties.  Originally, if a Western CP traded power in the West under 
the WSPP Agreement, we permitted the CP to enter into Enron Sales only for 
Eastern power pursuant to the on-line GTCs.  However, we have decided that 
certain of such CPs should not be permitted to trade Eastern power at all.  
Accordingly, please revise the profile for the CPs listed below so that they 
cannot buy or sell Eastern power products via EOL:

Arizona Public Service Company
Avista Corporation - Washington Water Power Division
British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation
California Department of Water Resources
City of Redding
Colorado Springs Utilities
Idaho Power Company
Los Angeles Department of Water & Power
Nevada Power Company
Northern California Power Agency
Pacificorp
Public Service Company of Colorado
Public Service Company of New Mexico
Sacremento Municipal Utility District
Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District
San Diego Gas & Electric Company
Seattle City Light
Sierra Pacific Power Company
St. Joseph Light & Power Co.
Tucson Electric Power Company

If any of these CPs have previously traded any Eastern power products, please 
let me know at your earliest convenience so that I can address this issue.

Please note that this change should not affect the ability of these CPs to 
trade Western power products.

Thanks:

Leslie

		 Subject: Conf Call with CalPERS

FROM SHIRLEY HUDLER:

Dave, Marty, Richard, Steve and Bill:

Thank you for taking the time this Thursday the 15th to spend time discussing 
the California situation with CalPERS.   The call is scheduled for 11:30 CST 
and will last at least an hour, possibly more.  

By way of background, ENE and CalPERS are 50/50 partners in JEDI II - which 
was created in December 1997.  JEDI II is a funding vehicle for Enron's 
energy related merchant investments.  Transactions of note are:  3.9% 
minority equity interest in EES, equity ownership in Quanta, 100% ownership 
of East Coast Power (since sold down to 51%), and participation in a number 
of E&P drilling partnerships and coal investments.  The commitment period was 
set to expire on December 31, 2000 - and was extended to March 31, 2001.   In 
addition, CalPERS invested $40 Million in The New Power Co prior to the 
IPO.   Andy and I are working with CalPERS to amend the current JEDI II 
partnership in order that we continue our successful relationship with 
CalPERS.  The Alternative Investment Management (AIM) staff that we work with 
are very supportive of Enron and we are looking at a number of opportunities 
to put their money to work in our businesses.  

CalPERS hasn't provided any specific questions that they want answered.  My 
thoughts on how to structure the call is for Marty to spend some time talking 
about California, Enron's role there and our view of the situation.  Then, 
Richard could address the regulatory status in California.  I would expect 
this to be somewhat of a freeform conference call.  One area we may discuss 
is how Enron and CalPERS can team up on a California initiative.  The AIM 
staff is interested in discussing this particular point.  

The following individuals from CalPERS senior staff will be on the call:

 Dan Szente, Chief Investment Officer
 Robert Aguallo, Chief Operating Officer

 Barry Gonder, Senior Investment Officer, AIM
 Rick Hayes, Senior Principal Investment Officer, AIM (primary Enron contact)

 Mark Anson, Senior Investment Officer, Public Equities
 Mary Cottrill, Senior Principal Investment Officer, Public Equities

 Lou Jug, Senior Principal Investment Officer, Real Estate

 Curtis Ishi, Senior Investment Officer, Fixed Income


Please give me a call if you have any questions.  For those of you here in 
the office,  we will be meeting in 
Marty Sunde's office (EB 889)

Dial:     1-888-380-9636

Subject: New and Exciting National Fuel Deal


We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

I'm sorry I never got in touch with you last weekend, but I had the wrong 
phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using 
Information.  I don't think I would have been much fun anyway since I pretty 
much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend.  In fact, I fell asleep in the 
car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents 
decided to just leave me in the car.  I think I was probably out there for an 
hour before I woke up (needless to say I was very confused).  Anyway, hope 
things are going well for you and Clay.  I know everything must be kind of 
crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the 
interviewing you've both no doubt been doing. 

I really want to get a chance to see you and chat...I don't feel like we've 
had a good one in forever.  I will be in Austin over Thanksgiving for the 
game, so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town.  If 
not, I'm sure I can manage at least one weekend trip during December if 
there's a good weekend for you.  Just drop me  a line when you get a chance 
and let me know what's new with you.

Subject: ABB Purchase Agreement

Kay:  Brice Golden insists that he has learned about the existance of a 
Purchase Agreement in place under which projects such as his for Ft Pierce 
can add their order for Transformers, without having to negotiate a stand 
alone contract.  Sort of an ala carte arrangement.  I have asked Sheila Tweed 
what she knew about this, and she said she had nothing, but did not know what 
you might have done.  I know we have done bulk purchases and later split for 
the different peaker  projects, and some others similar to that, but no 
blanket agreement.  What have you got?

Thought you might find this interesting (read: confusing)!  It's publicly available on the net, so it's ok.  How many other companies are going to come forward with their problems or get in deeper trying to ""quietly"" clean them up?

Still taking in the big win.  Seems more incredible in retrospect that it
did at the time.  Stoops could name his price!

I still would like the video.  I know that J.R. would be disappointed if you
paid him for the tickets.  He gave them to me to use as I please.  Let's go
to the Tour Championship and call it even.

Jonny,

Wow what a week.  I still can't believe it.  I will have the video in mail
overnight on Monday.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you got another
copy and don't need it.

Thanks again for the tickets and for driving.  It was fun being with Trey.
I hope B is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating
Madeline's birthday.  I can't believe you have a teenager.  We are getting
old.

I was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned
the price of the ticket.  $175!  I didn't realize that when you gave it to
me.  I really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us.  I
didn't mind his hospitality at $50 bucks but i simply didn't realize they
were that much -  I 've never been to the big dance before.  If your dad
wasn't comped the tickets from OU, Mark and I would like to reimburse him.

Please let me know the situation.

Cheers and Boomer Sooner,

0,"I haven't checked with all of my Managers, but I know at least some of them 
sent you their Satisfactory reviews and had not heard anything back from you 
by 7/31 which I think was the original deadline for completing reviews.   And 
I know that although I received feedback from you on my Needs Improvement 
employees, I didn't receive any formal feedback on my Satisfactory employees 
reporting directly to me.  I believe I recall a phone conversation that we 
had where you told me to go ahead and give the Satisfactory reviews.  At that 
point, I told all of my Managers to proceed with completing the reviews on 
their Satisfactory employees.  I believe that all of my department's reviews 
have been executed and turned in - save one for an Analyst as I am still 
waiting to hear feedback from his PRC rep.    So, based on your explanation 
of AnneMarie's memo, I guess I would like clarification.  Are any of the 51 
in my department?  Because, it could be that we went ahead and gave them when 
we were trying to get everything wrapped up in early August and be as timely 
as possible in giving constructive feedback to our employees based on our 
phone conversation - and that you're still waiting for us to provide them to 
you for review.  What I mean by it is ridiculous to wait so long to 
communicate performance feedback is : September?  

Sorry for any confusion.  Don't take things so personally - I'm venting at 
the process, not the people.

Subject: Re: Mid-Year PRC  

Ann Marie is our new HR Analyst on rotation with our HR team.  
The phrase, ""We still need to review 51 ""Satisfactory"" evaluations"", was a 
disclosure to Sally that the 51 evaluations have not been forwarded to HR for 
review.   I did not mean to imply that we were holding any evaluations 
because we have provided same or next day turn around on the evaluations that 
I received.    
As I read the e-mail, I am concerned that you might be under the impression 
that I have not provided quick turn-around to one or more members of your 
group.   If that is the case and I have not misinterpreted your e-mail, I 
would like the opportunity to address the issue with your staff so that I can 
correct the situation.   Has a manager told you that I held up an evaluation?
I do not have any ""satisfactory"" evaluations in my possesion that I am 
reviewing at this time.   
I wish you had told me of any issues that you perceived were delaying your 
evaluations because frankly, it was Sally that wanted us to review the 
satisfactory or below evaluations.   
Thanks for bringing the matter to my attention.   I was not aware that you 
thought the situation had become ridiculous and I would like to do everything 
possible to avoid giving you that impression.

work.  I thought that this was going to be corrected last week.  I am 
confused about why we are using a system that does not work.  I understand 
that there are bugs in the system.  Was the system tested before being put 
into production?  

I tried to reach you by phone.  You were unavailable and I could not leave a 
voice mail because that was full.  I talked with Torey Hayden and verbally 
okayed the access for Bob Hall.  

Please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and 
how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system 
is not functioning.  You might at least put a contact name and number on 
these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system

I of course would have lost in the first round also, but at least I would have scored a legit amount of points.  Once again the flee circus is winning with smoke and mirrors.  His last three week's scores don't even add up to 100 and he won all three.  He must be cheating.  I would also like to congratulate the Lions, I mean Extreme for its one win season.

Even though we have changed the reimbursement from 50 / 50 on both 
interconnects to each entity paying 100% of one interconnect I still feel the 
language requiring either party to reimburse the other if operational 
circumstances constrain the physical intent of the interconnect is still 
needed.  In this way both entities will be aligned in trying to insure both 
the receipt and delivery interconnects function as intended.  Please let me 
know if you disagree.

I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.  I tried
the
other connection and it works great.  I pulled all the tractor pictures off
the
camera with no problem.  I still have not seen a photo as clear as the very
first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.

All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy.

0,"John:

Here are two alternatives to the language in AB1X.

The language does two things:

1) ensures that DA customers' costs are shifted to utility customers.
2) ensures that DA customers' don't unfairly escape any costs (e.g., bond 
payments, etc.)

We're assuming that you'll shop these with Lenny and we'll work the Reps on 
SB 18?

Lemme know.

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based
trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long.""
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that.""
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.
""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.
""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.
     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

Soaring natgas prices revive interest in coal
December 07, 2000 3:31:00 PM ET
By Andrew Kelly 

HOUSTON, Dec 07 (Reuters) - Soaring prices for natural gas and concerns about 
future supplies are prompting U.S. electricity generators to take another 
look at coal which had fallen out of favor as gas dominated the nation's 
plans for new power plants. 

Wisconsin Electric started the ball rolling in September with plans to build 
two new 600 megawatt coal-fired power plants, the first to be announced in 
the United States in several years. 

Richard Grigg, president of the Wisconsin Energy Corp.(WEC) unit, said the 
decision was a simple matter of prudence and a way to avoid putting all of 
your eggs in one basket. 

""We believe that a strong diversity in your fuel mix is a very important part 
of having a reliable and low cost electricity supply,"" Grigg told Reuters in 
an interview. 

Although coal accounts for just over half of U.S. electricity production, the 
economic and environmental advantages of modern gas turbines had made the 
decision about how to fuel new power plants something of a no-brainer in 
recent years. 

Consequently, over 90 percent of new plants currently planned in the United 
States are slated to burn natural gas. 

But as natural gas prices soar, hitting all-time highs of over $9 per million 
British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange this week, Grigg 
suspects that other power producers will also take another look at coal. 

""Given increasing gas prices and concern for supply availability, I think 
you're going to see more people look for ways to utilize coal,"" Grigg said. 

BACK IN THE PICTURE 

Griff Jones, vice-president of power trading at Dynegy Inc. (DYN), said high 
natural gas prices and recent advances in clean combustion technology had put 
coal back in the picture. 

""A year or two ago people wouldn't bring up the subject of developing a coal 
plant. Today there's talk about it,"" he said. 

For Dynegy, which began as a natural gas marketer and has made the 
convergence of the natural gas and electric power businesses an article of 
faith, that is quite an admission. 

Since the oil price explosions of the 1970s, the share of oil used in U.S. 
power generation has dwindled to around 3 percent. 

Nuclear plants deliver about 20 percent of the nation's electricity but 
construction of new nuclear plants is widely viewed as politically impossible 
following the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl in 
1986. 

Natural gas currently supplies about 15 percent of U.S. electricity but is 
projected to gain market share steadily due to power generators' enthusiasm 
for the high efficiency and low emissions of the latest ""combined-cycle"" gas 
turbines. 

Oil and gas industry executives often cite projected growth in U.S. demand 
for natural gas of 30 trillion cubic feet by 2010, much of it fueled by 
increased use of gas for power generation. 

Plans for new gas-fired power plants are based on the assumption that the 
industry will be able to step up to the plate and deliver ever-increasing 
amounts of gas. 

FLAT GAS PRODUCTION 

In recent years, however, U.S. natural gas production has remained stubbornly 
steady around 19 billion cubic feet, augmented by Canadian imports of around 
3 billion cubic feet. 

The recent surge in gas prices has pushed the number of drilling rigs 
currently searching for gas in the United States to unprecedented levels of 
over 800 from just over 600 a year ago. 

But so far, at least, production remains more or less flat as gas producers 
fight the accelerating depletion of mature fields. 

Plans for a pipeline that would tap huge unexploited gas reserves in Alaska 
will alleviate the supply situation, but the gas would only start flowing in 
the second half of this decade. 

Coal, on the other hand, is abundant and readily available: the United States 
has reserves equivalent to well over 200 years of domestic consumption. 

Ray Niles, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, estimated in a recent report 
that the United States will need 300,000-400,000 megawatts of new electricity 
generating capacity over the next decade, or somewhere between 800 and 1,000 
new plants. 

Natural gas producers would be hard pressed to supply enough fuel for even 
half of that new capacity, he calculated. 

""Therefore, we think it likely that new coal-fired generating capacity will 
also be necessary to meet demand growth,"" Niles wrote. ""We see no alternative 
fuel capable of producing the necessary power, due to political and time 
constraints."" 

Wisconsin Electric's Grigg said it might not be long before other power 
generators followed his own company's lead and drew up plans for new 
coal-fired plants. 

""I have heard some rumblings from others that are also recognizing that 
economics as well as supply issues are starting to look more favorable for 
coal,"" he said.

0,"Wow--softball questions.  Two thoughts:  1, should we be gentler on the ""lack 
of takeaway capacity"" issue?  Steve would know how to play this given Socal's 
position.  2,  Did McKinsey check with Enron before taking this assignment 
from Cal?  The lack of conflict of interest rules in the consultant world 
never ceases to amaze me.  That being said, McKinsey is probably the best 
outfit we could hope for to take this investigation over for Cal.  I'd like 
to be on the call to be sure our script for FERC on the neg. rate deals 
dovetails with what we tell these guys.  Let me know when the call will be.  
We may know what the TW FERC order says before this conversation with 
McKinsey happens so lets talk again before the call.  Thanks.  df

McKinsey & Co. has been engaged by the State of California to evaluate 
conditions in the gas market to California.  A Mckinsey representative, 
together with a CEC staffer, asked to interview TW next Wednesday, Mar 28 
(time TBD).  I checked with Steve Kean & he encouraged us to proceed (albeit 
with some caution knowing California's great desire to shift blame).

McKinsey forwarded the attached list of questions.  You'll see that they are 
very general & policy oriented.  I have taken a stab at filling in proposed 
answers.

I'd be happy to field the call (together with Steve Harris if he is 
available).  Let me know if you have feedback and/or prefer to handle the 
call yourself.

Hi Mary, 
I don't have a clue who filed the original documents.  I know for a 
fact that ROW did not do the filing for this transaction.  It seems 
to me it would have been someone on EB38 who did the filing. 
Back a couple of months ago there were copies of some of the 
agreements in a meeting AE, Patrick Johnson, and I had (I 
think AE brought her copies to the meeting).  So, it would 
stand to reason that these copies should exist in AE's

Dear Jim/R.A. Seale,
I've been a member of Society for the Performing Arts for a number of years
and have enjoyed every minute.  The organization was founded in 1966 along
with the establishment of Jones Hall (construction began in 1964 under John
Jones/Houston Endowment leadership) and represents some of the finest
performers, dancers, musicians in the world.

We are appealing more broadly to our local foundations and need your help to
allow them to continue their fine outreach program.  As you can imagine, the
flooding of Jones Hall in June virtually devastated their offices and their
archives, but their outreach and education programs have continued due to
the staff's dedication to the arts.  They even managed to hang onto Mormon
Tabernacle Choir when Jones Hall was flooded by moving them over to Reliant
Hall.

Our city needs as much relief and beauty as we can muster in these difficult
times.  Thank you for strongly favoring this request.  Call Sally Tyler,
Director of Development, at 713-227-3384, if you need additional
information.

Would you mind breaking down the last invoice (four objects) by object so I know the bill for each.  I'd like to send some dough.

Have a great thanksgiving if we don't talk before then--I'm leaving wed for Kentucky, then London.

Let's plan to get together.  Maybe you'll come over to our humble little pad
and have a nice home-cooked meal.  Hillary is a really good cook.

I am sorry I didn't invite you to the wedding, Jeff.  I was going to and
then changed my mind when you seemed so stressed and hassled by your
work/travel schedule.  I didn't want you to feel obliged to travel if you
didn't want to.  I should have asked you your preference.  I hope you
understand.

I'm so glad you're okay, relatively speaking.  You're a great guy, Jeff, and
I hope that this experience helps you and me and everybody around us to
focus on what's actually important in our lives, and to be especially kind
to each other.

Please tell me when you're coming around

Warm Regards,
ben

Subject: RE: Jeff Skilling for TPG CEO Conference


Jeff, next October 23, 24, 25 in Laguna Niguel, Texas Pacific is hosting
their annual  portfolio company CEO conference (about 50 CEO;s in
attendance).  TPG ( a client of mine), you may know, is a premier private
equity investor--known best perhaps for Continental Airlines or if you ride
motorcycles Ducati,. $10billion in funds investment and good guys, you may
have met Jim Coulter, or David Bonderman or Bill Price, the senior
partners. They love to have you as their keynote speaker and I think it
would be worth your while.  Let me know if it works or whether I can
connect you up with them directly. I hope all is going well and
congratulations on your formal recognition as CEO.. Cheers Bill  P.S. Steve
Ballmer mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago that his meeting with you
last year was ""one of the most influential he's had""

CEO Conference





Bill --

As we discussed by voicemail, it would be great if you could connect with
Jeff Skilling to see if he would be interested in speaking at the TPG CEO
conference on the topic of Growth. Kristina sent over to Dick a copy of our
growth pamphlet, which he may also wish to use at the conference.  Enron is
featured prominently in the pamphlet as a great example of a growth story.

By way of background for Jeff, TPG has combined funds of well over $10
billion under management including its most recent $4.5 billion fund.
Their investments are loosely split between telecom, high tech, Europe and
all other.  They also have partial interests in a number of specialty funds
including Newbridge (Asia and Latin American), Aqua (water-related
investments), Colony (real estate), Gryphon (early stage, growth) and a
number of others including newly created venture and crossover funds.
There will be over 50 CEOs at their conference, including Continental
Airlines, America West, Del Monte, Beringer, Ducati, Bally, and a host of
others.

I can't remember the exact date for the conference, but I think Dick
mentioned the fall time frame.

Please let me/Dick know if Jeff would be interested in speaking with Dick
further.

0,"Ray, couple of comments:
 a) Donahue is responsible for the portfolio management function but also 
incorporate the idea of Jeff being responsible for ENA's ""capital book"" (ie) 
managing existing deals and intimately involved in conjunction with Treasury 
and the various origination groups of which finance transactions get or don't 
get on our books;
 b) Has Fastow clearly put Defner in the ENA Treasurer role? - if so we 
should also mention this in the note;
 c) Chuck Ward ( Generation Investments); Don Miller ( Merchant Generation);
 and d) with regard to commodity structuring ensure it is clear that they 
will facilitate and structure the highest priority/value transactions across 
the organization even though they report to Janet (ie) they don't just work 
on East Origination deals.

Let me see the final before release. Make sure Mark is on side.

Here is their response to our comments.  Not much but take a look:

Under term7:  Notices - unless we include language similiar to...'Fax is 
acceptable as long as the fax is followed by hardcopy documentation and 
effective upon such hardcopy reciept.'  Back to square one.  They don't like 
fax.
Under term 8:  they are objecting to affiliate assignment.  Successor is ok.  
Affiliate assignment is no good.  They would like to take out the term 
assigns.

that is it.

0,"Shona:  Thank you for your memo.  I think it is a good idea to define roles 
and responsibilities and I appreciate the fact  that you have taken the 
initiative to do so.  However, I do have the following comments:

1) I have some accountability to Rick Buy for the success of this effort, 
therefore I (or my designee) need to be involved in Doorstep pre- planning 
and post-mortem.  I will be involved in reviewing the final report before 
presentation and will attend  the meeting when the report is presented to Buy 
and Causey.

2) I realize that  in the interest of getting a review done timely it is 
sometimes necessary to ""divide and conquer"".  However, where logistically 
possible, I believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in 
meetings held with Commercial personnel.  This facilitates understanding 
operations, document flow, points of contact, report writing as well as 
furthering our goal of educating ""multi-functional"" people so that we can 
continue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviews.

3) There are still some detailed issues that need to be clarified regarding 
the database.  Let's schedule another meeting with Cassandra and Donna.

Please let me know if you have any questions,         Regards,       Rick"

		 Subject: Enron Online: Counterparty Authority


In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it in
detail.

1.  The Issue

The essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May 12,
i.e. the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claim
that the transaction is not binding because:

(a) it was outside the company's business purposes, or
(b) execution of the application was not authorized.

This issue is not unique to Japan

There is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the trading
of any of the products through the internet, including issues as to 
contractual
enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet, on which we advised
on 15 March.  A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email.

Neither is there any question, if the above issue is resolved, of the 
Electronic
Trading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the 
contract.
(We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect.)

2.  Enron's Practice re EOL

Our understanding is that:

* Potential customers have been sent the password application under cover
of a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application.  
Neither
the letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form.

* Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a credit
standpoint but also, we understand from Mark Taylor, to quickly confirm the
authority of the signer (by e.g. in the case of a U.S. counterparty, checking 
if
the signatory shows the title ""director"" alongside his name).

* If satisfied, Enron then signs the acceptance part of the application
and issues a password.

* Four applications had been received regarding Japan as of 11am today and
none has yet been approved.

3.  Business Purposes

Article 43 of the Civil Code provides that a juristic person has rights and
obligations in accordance with law and the business purposes specified in its
constituent documents.  Where a corporation enters into a contract outside its
business purposes, the contract is prima facie void.

However, if the counterparty did not know that the contract was beyond the 
power
of the corporation, and was not negligent in failing to know such fact, the
contract will be enforced under Article 110 of the Civil Code.

The most prudent practice would be for Enron to obtain a copy of the
counterparty's business purposes (certified by the Legal Affairs Bureau or by 
a
representative director) and form a view on whether the proposed transaction
falls within those purposes.

However, since Japanese companies' business purposes, after listing a limited
number of specific purposes, generally include a final item along the lines of
""all incidental or ancillary business"", it is common for companies to not make
this inquiry except in the most major contracts.

With respect to statutory corporations, however, care is required because 
often
their business purposes are in fact limited.

Accordingly, a rule of thumb solution would be: if the counterparty name does
not contain ""Kabushiki Kaisha"" or ""Yugen Gaisha"" at the end of the name, to 
make
further inquiries.

4.  Authority to Bind the Company - The Law

The position in Japan is similar to that in a number of other countries in the
sense that:

(a)  Deemed Authority

The law provides for a form of execution which, if followed, entitles a party 
to
presume that the company is bound.  In Japan, this involves the execution of a
contract by the company's ""representative director"".  This corresponds to the
presumption concerning the affixing of the company seal in some states of the 
US
and in the UK, and the execution of the contract by 2 directors in Australia.

It is possible for the powers of the representative director to be restricted 
by
law or the constituent documents of the corporation. (Article 53 of the Civil
Code) but if the counterparty did not know of such restriction, the contract 
is
still binding on the company.

(b)  Apparent Authority

In common, with other countries, Japan has a concept of apparent authority.
Article 262 of the Commercial Code provides:

 ""A company shall be liable to a bona fide third party for any act done
by a director invested with any title such as president, vice president,
executive director or managing director from which it may be assumed that he 
has
authority to represent the company, even in cases where the person has no 
power
of representation.""

Articles 37 and 38 of the Commercial Code extend the same concept to ""general
managers"" (so shihainin).  It is generally considered that Article 43 then
applies the concept to ""an employee who has been entrusted with certain types 
of
matters or specific matters.""

Accordingly, in addition to persons having the titles listed in Article 262
(above), the general view is that persons having titles such as general 
manager
and division manager (bucho), will be deemed to have the authority to 
represent
the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the 
company's
business for which they are responsible.

It is also likely that section managers (kacho) or section chiefs (kakaricho)
have power to bind the company to a certain extent in areas for which they are
responsible.

(e)  Holding Out

Even if an employee of the company is acting outside his actual authority, if
the company has held the employee out as having authority, the company will be
bound by his/her action.

5.  Practical Considerations

In formulating an approach for Enron to take on the basis of the above law, 
the
following factors are relevant:

(a)  Practice regarding Representative Director Seal

It is common for a counterparty to seek to take the advantage of the 
presumption
referred to in 4(a) above by requiring the representative director's corporate
seal to be affixed (and, if contract is in English, for him to sign) or  to
insist on tracing the ""chain of authority"" of the signatory up to the
representative director (e.g. by power of attorney), for major or unusual
transactions.

(b)  Size of Transaction

The question is what transactions fall into the ""major"" or ""unusual"" category.

Unfortunately the cases on this do not allow a clear line to be drawn.  As in
many other countries, the answer depends on factors such as those noted in 
(c),
(d) and (e) below, which vary company by company.

Accordingly, where the contract involves (or could involve) a considerable
ongoing exposure by the company, Japanese corporations would not be surprised 
to
be asked for the signatory to be at a certain level, or for written 
confirmation
of the signatory's authority to be obtained from a person at such level.

(c)  Size of Company

While it would be prudent and normal to insist upon the representative
director's seal being affixed to a contract of the present type in the case 
of a
smaller company, it would not be normal practice to so insist in the case of a
major company such as a bank or major trading company counterparty, in which
companies lower level employees are presumed to have greater authority.

(d)  Business Department of Signatory

The counterparty is more likely to be bound under the apparent authority
doctrine if the signatory is in (and carries a title which refers to) the
relevant business department (e.g. energy), than if he is not.

(e)  Degree of Exposure

To the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to 
expose
the counterparty to considerable liability, the possibility of a counterparty 
in
the future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant a
reasonably conservative approach.

(f)  Recent History

However, even when faced with considerable losses during the recent economic
crisis, Japanese companies (at least major companies) have not generally
attempted to use lack of authority as a defense, presumably because of
reputation considerations.

(g) Identity of Addressee

The title of the person to whom the invitation letter is sent may be relevant.
For example, if it was sent to the General Manager of the relevant department,
but the application came from a section chief, there would be strong argument
that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary
authority.

(h)  Internal Procedures

Since the law concerning execution by a representative director can be
considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in
some countries, and by two directors in for example Australia, the Japanese
rules are not out of line with those of other countries.

Accordingly, it should be necessary for Enron to take a more stringent 
approach
to Japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in other
countries.  The procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient for
Japan as well, although some adjustment will need to be made for Japan's 
unique
regime of company titles.

6.  Conservative Approach

If the online transactions are treated as a major or unusual transaction for 
the
counter-party, under common practice Enron would require:

* The application to be executed under the registered seal of (and counter
signed by) a representative director, or by a person who is able to produce
documentation showing a line of authority originating with a representative
director.

* A certified copy of the seal register.

* A certified copy of the register of the company issued by the Legal
Affairs Bureau, to confirm the business purposes and the identity of the
representative director.

7.  Less Conservative Approach

Major Companies

For major Japanese trading companies, banks, insurance companies and other
companies of equivalent size, the following approach could be adopted which
would not be out of line with market practice:

* The application to be executed by a manager (or general manager)(bucho)
of the relevant department or above, or

* By a person able to establish a line of authority from such party.

A more aggressive approach would involve accepting applications signed by a
person at the level of section manager (kacho) or section chief (kakaricho), 
but
this is right ""on the line"" and we would prefer Enron to do so only if there 
is
some history of dealings with the company or other evidence to back up an
apparent authority argument.

Smaller Companies

For other companies the approach would be as set out in 6. above.

Perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark for
dividing between small and large companies.

8.  Likely Response of Target  Companies

Your marketing experts will be in a better position than us to form a view 
but,
taking into account Japanese commercial practice, we do not believe any 
company
is likely to be offended if Enron responds along the above lines to an
application signed by a person who does not meet the above suggested approach,
particularly taking into account that the approach is not inconsistent with 
the
correspondence and application form the companies have been sent and no
applications have yet been approved.

We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or 
trading
of any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.  
Under
Japanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.

Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or
acceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties 
may
make most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishing
that the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In 
most
simple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy to
prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller's
electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy 
product
Y should be enough in this context.

In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should 
be
carefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to 
the
question of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, the
legal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may be
somewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over the
counter).  Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,
the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the
product. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click 
on
an Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, 
with a
carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able 
to
let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the
icon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and
conditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrap
in the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the
customer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly may
be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.

If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or 
U.K.
law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,
including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.

We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws,
regulations, or court cases.  So long as  the party maintains the relevant
website with a computer server located outside Japan, the likelihood of 
Japanese
regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website
established a ""physical"" establishment/branch in Japan is negligible.

First - congratulations on your year 2000 to date. From what I have
researched, Enron is an incredible organization of products, services and
people.

I represent MobileStar - the worlds largest public Wireless Lan company.
Based in Dallas, and private at this time - we have built and will continue
to build a WIFI IEEE 802.11b lan network in public places such as hotels,
airports, airline clubs and retail/coffee house type places where mobile
users go, eat, move, meet and sleep.  You will find us today in many
Marriotts, Hiltons, Sheratons and American Airline Admiral club rooms-
offering unteathered T-1 speed connectivity to a company lan or the
internet.

We are soon to launch Hong Kong Int Airport and the London airports as well.
We also have a confidential network partner/s in the works to be announced
in the next 30 days that will take our public network to over 5000 locations
in the next 2 years. You will be interested I assure you.

I feel that not only is MobileStar a service that could benefit your mobile
global staff that travels both domestically, locally and internationally,
but also a partner tie in terms of content delivery, possible backbone
partnerships and video/Blockbuster delivery to a MobileStar subscribers
handheld, Ipaq computer or laptop.

I would very much like the opportunity to meet with both your IT team whom
investigates wireless applications and services for your personnel as well
as a member of your Broadband Development team.

Also - I will offer you a FREE trial subscription to our network for  your
travels.

I thank you for your time.

PS - We are heading into Series C funding..........

Joe,

Although I don't have his bio, I've known Herve Joanjean for about 10 years.
He has served in the EU mission t the WTO as a mid level market access
negotiator and in Brussels mostly on industrial goods market access
negotiations.  His move to Madelin's job is a lateral one from the
industrial goods side to the services side of DG-Trade.

In the mid 90s, I worked with Herve quite a bit and found him to be
trustworthy and conscientious.  He was a pleasure to work with, and although
we will miss having Robert in the Services position, Herve is a good
replacement.

Bob Vastine reports that Robert Madellin will be moving from the Services
portfolio this fall to Agriculture and some other high sounding
responsibility. He is being succeeded by Herve Jouanjean with Michel Servoz
as number 2. Does anyone have biographical information on Herve
Jouanjean???

Andrew Buxton who heads the European Services Network will be here for
meetings with CSI and ISACs this week and also in NYC with CSI and
Japaneese counterparts. Bob told me that Vivendi is the only energy
interest involved as members of Andrew's group and they have expressed no
interest in liberalized energy services. This would seem to be an
opportunity for the UK electricity association to advise him of their
interests and possibly the drilling people.

During the ISAC 13 meeting last week, USTR Peter Collins reported that the
WTO Working Party Dealing With China's accession had expressed concern with
the recent negotiation in which the Chineese won a series of exemptions and
in the case of energy services and possibly e-commerce there are price
controls.  We were told that a number of law firms in Washington are
opposing any USTR acceptance of this provision and Bob Vastine informed
ISAC 13 members should they have a view on price controls.

Trade Ministers will meet in September and are likely to ratify the China
accession regardless of the WTO Working Group issues.  You need to let us
know if Enron should consider filing a statement regarding price controls
for energy services and e-commerce services.

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

In response to the below, there was a short planning meeting between 
Commercial Support and IT, specific objectives were identified which would 
enhance the DPR and reporting process, and improve the robustness of our 
processes, the following has been agreed in principle:

1. Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, 
pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.
2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be 
signed off by risk management before end of day.
3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a 
comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's 
portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to 
be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )
4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be 
reported to technical support in the event of a failure.  

The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time 
for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning 
of the next trading day.

Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each 
business area/valuation system for the following:
a) current state
b) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking
c) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - 
Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - 
implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )

Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full 
commercial signoff

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

0,"It's unfortunate that the state's largest utility was forced to turn to the 
courts for a resolution.  Solutions to the state's energy crisis have been 
available for months that would have avoided this scenario, but Gov. Davis 
and the Legislature lacked the bold leadership to take swift, decisive 
action. 

Enron's exposure to PG&E will not have any material effect on earnings or on 
our financial condition.

If pressed:  Any further comment would be speculative, as we have not yet 
seen the filing."

I can't read these - but my real quesiton is - If the $.07 is a demand charge and Grigsby gets $.04, we should still get the other $.03 because it will be charged on all volumes that CAN be taken, whether they take them or not - right??

Thanks for having us up to Beaver Creek this weekend.  We had a wonderful
time.  I told Raul that Colorado needs to be our vacation every summer bc
this was our best one by far!  Anyway, it was a fun spending time with you
guys and your parents in such a relaxing place.

We need to get together soon and share pictures.  Also, I don't know if I
can go that long without laughing with and at you!

Tell Megan thanks too!

Hi Charlotte,

We've been invited to someone's house for dinner on Feb 2.  Can you take
care of Michael?  The dinner is in River Oaks, so we could just drop him
off.

Michael  got a hair cut this weekend.  I think it makes him look taller.  I
wish it worked that way for me!  It is very short, and I think very cute.

0,"AP--

               In a shocking move that will have the rest of the Big 12 
playing recruiting
               ""catch-up"", OU has snatched a solid commitment from all-state 
wide out
                                  
               Delmer Shanks

               As a freshman, Shanks is expected to play in the ""Opossum"" set 
of OU's
               daunting new offense. 
               ""The opossum spread is going to really fool people next year"", 
Shanks
               explained in a phone interview from an Oklahoma Kwickie Mart.
               ""In the possum set, we take the left tackle and line him up 
out with 2 or 3
               of our receivers. I lay up in the backfield, like a opossum, 
and then the
               center hikes the ball to the Tight End and then it's a hand 
off to either me
               or the quarterback."".
               When asked about why he commited to OU in the middle of the 
season,
               a usually slow time of year for recruiting, Shanks had this to 
say.
               ""Well it was a no-brainer really.Skoalis going to be 
sponsoring OU
               athletics next year, so it just seemed like a natural fit. I 
really liked what
               they're gonna do with the uniforms, that sown-in dip ring 
they're putting on
               everyone's back pockets are gonna look real nice. They're also 
gonna do
               some neat stuff with the Switzer center too, gonna sell moon 
pies and
               stuff at the door.""
               Shanks did not take any official visits to other schools 
before his
               commitment, though he did say Texas A&M and OU had expressed
               interest in him all along.
               ""Yeah, they were plenty nice at A&M and Coach Slocum talked to
               momma a lot on the phone. He told her that this was gonna be 
the year
               they would pass more and that I would fit in real good with 
their high
               power pro-style attack"".
               It turns out that Delmer's mother did influence his decision 
some. A
               laughing Shanks explains,
               ""Yeah, we was out back pitching washers and momma come

Daren,

Is Fred's below concern something that you might be able to help us with?  I 
was thinking that (maybe) the volumes from this meter might belong to HPL.  
This is one of the meters that no longer go thru King Ranch.

Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the HPL Liquids contract

removed the volume from the Liquids contract at this meter and temporarily

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

The F/M relief sited may not apply in all instances because technically we 
may have failed to preserve our rights by not notifying Furnas for 6 months.  
They have responded as such although they have not assessed any penalties to 
date.  The real test is may 4 when we are supposed to be in Phase 3 on Gas.

Subject: Re: Period after commissioning on oil - PPA availability penalties 
vs. diesel cost exposure  

Pete,

 There are two types of penalties under the PPA for the account of EPE (the 
latter can be used as a hedge to diesel cost exposure and we don't have any 
penalties right now)

(1) Delay penalties in being unable to provide the guaranteed capacity of 480 
MW on gas starting May 4, 2001 (this is where the Force Majeure extension is 
able to provide relief). The penalties here are calculated as R$ 400 per 
delayed MW per day. 

(2) Penalties due to capacity shortfall (basically - are we able to meet 
dispatch requests). If the moving average of the monthly average of the 
projects equivalent availability, calculated in accordance with provisions of 
annex-7 of the PPA, is less than 92%, a penalty shall be assessed in the 
amount of monthly capacity portion of the tariff for each phase times the 
guaranteed capacity for the phase multiplied by (92% - moving average of the 
monthly availability).

Penalties type (1) does not apply in the concept analyzed as it relates to 
delay in gas (Force Majeure Claim issue). 

Refusing a dispatch request above 220 MW has an impact on penalties type (2) 
(guaranteed capacity is 300 MW). Given that the plant currently has a moving 
average of the monthly availability of about 99.7%, there is a margin built 
up that can be used to accept an availability hit by refusing a dispatch 
request above 220 MW. Therefore, to avoid the huge fuel costs associated with 
being dispatched above 220 MW, the PPA availability penalty concept can be 
utilized as an alternative. If we continue to decline to be dispatched above 
220 MW for a long period however, the built up margin will be reduced and 
eventually we'll have to pay penalties because the 12-month moving average 
moves below 92%.

Please let me know if additional questions

Subject: HB 2107 update and PUCT ruling

The PUCT ruled today that the utilities' excess earnings balance will be 
credited to the wires...amortized over 7 years with 7.5% interest beginning 
Jan 1, 2002.  (Trueup was not until 2004).  Utilities are unhappy however, 
this is the direction the commission had indicated they were heading a few 
weeks ago.  The excess earnings total over $6 billion dollars (new numbers 
came out today).  

I visited with Rep. Turner today after the commission's ruling, AECT set up a 
meeting with him to cut a deal.  Our commitment with Turner is that he will 
not harm the headroom created in SB 7 and subsequent PUCT decisions.  Turner 
was not completely happy with the commission's order because he was hoping 
for a larger refund check to rate payers.  Our amendment to HB 2107 (which 
refunds the excess earnings to the wires) is in line with the commission's 
decision.  When we signed on board with Turner, he said that if we stood with 
him, he would protect our interest.  Thank you for letting us get on board 
with him.  The IOUs are trying to cut a deal with him and because we stood 
with him...our interest should come first (as he has stated). 

During the HB 2107 committee hearing in March, Baker (TXU)  indicated that 
excess earnings should be returned to the wires (in 2004 trueup).  (I am 
getting the transcript of that hearing in the morning to confirm my memory).  

In a hearing on Nov 8, 2000 at the PUCT, Shaeffer ( Reliant) testified ""We 
believe that if we overrecover stranded investment, that we're going to 
refund the dollars down to the book value"".  Of course he meant during the 
2004 trueup, however, with the overcollection reaching $6 billion - and with 
today's commission ruling - a refund of the overcollection before 2004 is 
inevitable.  

Chairman Wolens (off the record) indicated today that HB 2107 would go to 
conference.  I think it is safe to infer he thinks the bill will pass the 
House and move to the Senate.  Turner has worked the Black Caucus, Hispanic 
Caucus and the Democratic Caucus.  

Rep. Counts (West Texas Conservative D) stood with Turner at the press 
conference along with Rep. Bailey and Rep. Hodge...each of them advocated for 
a refund of the overcollection.  (At the press conference Turner stated that 
he would drop his bill and wait until the 2004 trueup if the utilities would 
agree to keep everyone's lights on until the 2004 trueup.) The bill is likely 
to be heard on the House floor next Tuesday.

I did not provide comments/quotes to Fort Worth Star Telegram...they were 
told I was at the Capitol at a hearing.  I am working on a formal statement 
and gathering the support of other market participants with our interest to 
sign on.  I will run that by you before anything goes out. 

Thus far, Enron, Calpine, New Energy, Strategic,  and Excelon are willing to 
publically support our amendment to HB 2107.  (Others are supporting it but 
won't come out of the closet because they fear the utilities.) We are talking 
to Shell on Friday.  (They got confused and are supporting the bill as 
filed...which hurts headroom...they like our amendment but want to talk 
Friday before supporting it.)  

Thanks for your help with this, Jean 
"
0,"Gentlemen,

I've been told that the parties have agreed to extend the letter agreement 
until June 15, and that we will have a signed long term document by then.  

David,  I would think I simple letter agreement should work.  I can get it 
working from here.

I'm working on what was the most recent form that I had re the long term 
deal, which should address some of David's issues.  I'm not sure yet when 
I'll have it done, but it has moved up the list of priorities.

Talk to you soon, I'm sure.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced today that Ivan Boileau has been named g=
eneral manager of Garden State Paper, its recycled newsprint mill in Garfie=
ld, New Jersey.  Ivan was formerly the assistant general manager of Enron's=
 Papiers Stadacona paper mill in Quebec City, where he was responsible for =
pulping, paper machine operations and maintenance. Under Ivan's leadership,=
 Garden State Paper is expected to increase annual production, as well as p=
roduce higher quality recycled newsprint at a lower cost.
Enron acquired Garden State Paper in July 2000 and Papiers Stadacona in Apr=
il 2001. The acquisition of both mills now positions Enron as the seventh l=
argest producer of newsprint in North America. Enron began offering various=
 financial hedges to the Forest Products industry in 1997, and today is the=
 world's leading provider of customized financial risk management services =
to both buyers and sellers of pulp, paper and wood products. In addition, E=
nron provides capital services, inventory management and long-term fixed pr=
icing contracts for physical product for up to 10 years.

EIM Trading
Enron Industrial Markets Middle Office has a busy six months ahead of it as=
 it works to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to handle the treme=
ndous growth in the Industrial Markets Trading.  Key milestones will be the=
 continuous improvement of customer service (both internal and external), t=
he development/retention of team members, and the implementation of the fir=
st phase of new systems focused on electronic trade capture, robust physica=
l order management, and settlements.  These milestones will be key to a str=
ong finish in 2001 and being in a good position for the growth expected in =
2002.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Gas TPA agreement signed in Spain
Some very good news just in from Spain.  Last week, Enron Espa?a Generaci?n=
 and Enagas reached a long-term agreement whereby Enagas will provide Enron=
 Espa?a Generaci?n with regasification and transport services of natural ga=
s of approximately 1,7bcm annually between Huelva and our planned combined =
cycle gas turbine plant at Arcos de la Frontera (Cadiz).  The services will=
 begin in 2004, a date that coincides with our planned schedule for commenc=
ement of operations for the plant.  Well done to all the team.

Enron launches derivatives for three new tanker freight routes in shipping =
market
Enron's tanker freight team has this past week increased their derivatives =
portfolio (freight futures or 'swaps' of monthly contracts up to four month=
s out) for three new tanker freight routes on EnronOnline. The tanker freig=
ht derivatives will be benchmarked against published indices for the three =
routes on the 'Baltic International' (BITRA) and International Independent =
Tanker Rate Assessment (IITRA) exchanges to help ship-owners (including oil=
 companies), charterers, traders and even banks with exposure to the shippi=
ng market, mitigate the volatility of the freight element of tanker voyages=
 traveling from Singapore to Japan (30,000 tonnes), the Caribbean to the US=
 Gulf (70,000 tonnes) and Rotterdam to New York (33,000 tonnes).  Derivativ=
es for the three routes will be managed out of the Singapore, Houston and L=
ondon offices respectively.  ""Volatility of the tanker freight market has b=
een as high as 62% on some routes,"" explains Scott Moncrieff, Enron's direc=
tor of Liquids Freight Trading, based in London.  ""This has increased the i=
mportance of freight in relative terms on most tanker routes""=20

""In nine months we have already traded more than 3 million tonnes of paper =
freight, with a value of more than USD 14 million on the existing 80,000 to=
nne Sullom Voe (North Sea) to Willemshaven (Germany) route, and we expect t=
o achieve similar levels of interest on our three new routes.  The tanker f=
reight market is estimated to be worth more than USD 15 billion annually, a=
nd with increased liquidity being brought to the sector because of more pla=
yers entering the market there's plenty of opportunity for us to build our =
business.""

The tanker freight team is also very heavily involved in the physical chart=
ering of tanker vessels in Europe, The Americas, Arabian Gulf, Mediterranea=
n, Far East and US West Coast, utilizing both the spot shipping market and =
Enron-controlled 'time-charter' vessels.

Nordic Pre-Pay Deal
The Nordic origination team has closed their first municipality power pre-p=
ay deal in the last week. This is the first deal to be completed based on a=
 financing structure that Enron Nordic Energy negotiated with Den Norske Ba=
nk earlier this summer. The deal is an important reference for municipaliti=
es that are interested in raising cash without selling their ownership in l=
ocal power companies.

Steel Products
In March 2001 the European Steel Group commenced operations as an expansion=
 of the successful effort underway in North America.  The group offers both=
 physical and financial commodity grade steel products and serves as the on=
ly market-maker for a commodity market that is larger than that of crude oi=
l.  The mission is to introduce the concept of indexation and financial con=
tract to an industry where price transparency and risk management are virtu=
ally non-existent.  Physical and financial contracts for hot rolled and col=
d rolled steel are currently on offer via EnronOnline.  Interest from Europ=
ean producers and end-users is keen with the first financial transactions e=
xpected to close by the end of Q3.=20

Since the team's inception they have successfully completed transactions wi=
th counterparties in Kazakhstan, Egypt, and China amounting to nearly 50,00=
0 metric tonnes of steel. =20

Forest Products
Enron's European Forest Products group is now trading physical market pulp =
to complement the financial derivatives products already offered for the la=
st 2 years, increasing the volume under contract by 30%.=20

Over the past six months, the group has recruited physical pulp traders to =
handle its day-to-day physical pulp trading business.  ""We have sourced lon=
g-term physical supplies of ""market pulp"" from around the world which will =
complement the financial derivative products we have already been offering,=
"" explains Martin Holmes, Director of Enron's European Forest Product Opera=
tions.

By trading both physical and financial contracts, Enron is pioneering more =
creative pricing in the industry by offering physical and financial cash an=
d forward prices, as well as being the only market maker to quote longer da=
ted swaps.

The group is also actively looking at structured finance opportunities incl=
uding a number of inventory deals. These opportunities have arisen as the b=
enchmark pulp price for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK) has fallen =
by 45% over the past 6 months, leaving producers with high levels of pulp i=
nventory in warehouses.

On 2nd July, the group launched the first standard contract for Bleached Eu=
calyptus (BEK) pulp on EnronOnline, and is actively marketing to industry b=
rokers to adopt the contract as the benchmark index for pricing. The contra=
ct meets the commodity specifications of the BEK contract on the London Pul=
pex futures exchange, where Enron is the only market maker for all pulp fut=
ures contracts offered.

Attached is the revised Petition and Points and Authorities  (the Sept. 8 Draft"").  This draft has not been redlined because the changes  and additions are extensive.  Future revisions will be  redlined.
 
This draft will be revised to clarify the arguments, to  include page references to the exhibits, to include missing authorities, and to  eliminate typos, etc.
 
The argument is that the Commission acted contrary to state  and federal constitutional guaranties (a de novo standard of review) and that  the Commission acted in excess of its authority and contrary to law thereby  abusing its discretion (a substantial evidence standard of review).
 
You will be provided a revised draft by noon on Monday (Sept  10) which I anticipate will be substantially complete.  As soon as it is  available, I will send it to you.  At that time do you want it also sent to  the addressees listed in ypur Friday Email?  EWD

0,"We have a verbal okay from El Paso to go to the insurance wrappers and get structure/pricing.  The insitituions will then pitch this back to us both (El Paso and Enron) for a decision.  Once the decision is made, the process should be fairly swift.

As a back up plan, Joe asked the institutions to have the insurers look at a wrap without fixing the confidentiality/guarantee and using an Enron to fill any potential holes.  We'll then be able to balance timing vs proceeds vs legal risk.

_______________________________________________________________

Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up:
                                         1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and
15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections is
to significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event that
governmental action related to the agreement is modified in a manner
unacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can come
at any time during the term of the agreement, and need not  involve
approval  ""required"" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did not
propose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement which
refers to adverse ""rate approval"". However, Peoples' intent may be to
obtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decision
re the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of a
termination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarily
required for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified ""in any manner
which is unacceptable"" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with the
original language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right to
circumstances when a ""required"" approval is revoked.) While the broadened
termination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, I
wouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of a
modified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agency
arrangement.
2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenue
definition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market Hub
Serivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, the
proposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the term
of the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to market
extended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination of
the Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C)
eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue.
Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the last
sentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative net
revenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3,
apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH's
perspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actually
refunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not require
a retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreement
terminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would be
needed.
3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it make
nominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt or
delivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at a
secondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. did
agree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not know
the value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint.
                         4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC be
defined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion.
Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC may
elect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peoples
can, at most, ""propose"" changes in its sole discretion. How about: ""the
effective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may be
modified from time to time."" Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to propose
changes to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here.
                              5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate that
Parking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review this
further.                      6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified the
language giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC to
assign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply with
requirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not be
certificated as a ""natural gas company"", if there is another entity with
clear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act and
FERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicating
that Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensure
compliance with regulatory requirements.
          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of the
sending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change in
information re firm capacity. Perhaps ""in its sole discretion"" can be
delted and the last word of the third sentence changed to ""appropriate"".
                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list of
grounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies the
grounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should not
add to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce provided
under the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illiniois
tariffs have equal scheduling priority.
                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places the
risk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. This
is how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,
however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,
MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. With
the changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment risk
also may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should follow
responsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-payment
risk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or
(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based on
a credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).
     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to the
administrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refunds
for ten business days. Should there be an interest component?
                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. This
Section suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'm
don't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.
Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimize
imbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 are
expected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoples
should attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them on
Wed.
                    13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties to
indicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with ""material"" contractcs and
Judgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect. Is it
suffucuent to have minor contract violations and inconsistency with some
Laws/Judgments?               14. Sect. 7.1 The NIGAS Hub Agreement did not
have a flat fee component.
15. Sect. 10.1. Because the Governmental Approval must be acceptable to
both Peoples and MEH, People should not have ""sole"" authority to prepare
and file all applications.
                                         16. Sect. 10.2. See comments above
re Governmental Approval. Also, I don't think there is a need for the word
""expressly"" in the first sentence.            17. Sect. 11.1. Should the
Section require consent for transfer by operation of law if we wish to have
this requirement in the event that the Hub facilities are sold?

          18. Sect. 15.1 (a). If this type of provision is going to be
included, should there at least be an initial period (say a year) to get
started which doesn't trigger a termination right? The NIGAS Agreement had
a section along these lines.
          19. Sect. 15.1 (f). See comments above re Governmental Approval.
                                                   20. Former 15.1 (f) now
deleted. This provided that the Agency Agreement could be terminated is MEH
is dissolved. This seems necessary to me.          21. 15.1 (g) Peoples
wishes to have sole discretion to change its Facilities or the GTC, but
proposes to limit MEH's termination right in the event that such a change
impairs the HUB's marketability. It seems reasonably to allow MEH to
terminate if it believes that HUB marketability is impaired, without a need
to demonstrate reasonableness.
                                         22. Sect. 17.1 I don't understand
why Peoples wishes to require confidentiality for the compensation
sections. The Illinois Commission Staff and interested parties would have
access to this information under a protective agreement. This would
unnecessarily complicate the approval process and I don't know what there
is to gain from secrecy. These provisions were part of the public record in
the NIGAS approval case.                                     That's all.
Let's discuss tomorrow.

Subject: Gorons

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-


What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a ""cushy""  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to ""invent the
Internet"" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, ""Love Story"" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton ""one of
the greatest Presidents of our history.""

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and
that of the USA.

   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to
aid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to
your normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

Hey Chris,

Sorry about the phone call -- kinda difficult being discreet around here --
you know!

Yes! I'd definitely like to meet anytime this week.  Lunchtime might be
kinda rough for

you and me both, eh?  So,....maybe dinner one or more nights this week??
I'm available

any evening this week.  Just let me know!


I also spoke with Marde @ EES.  She says that ""Tom Hermanic"" from her group
will

be calling me soon as well.  It appears that they could use a good
Northeast/CNG

scheduler in the Commodity Risk Management group ASAP.  I applied for the
position via

Marde and the Job# as is posted on the Enron company job site (online).
Just reading

over the qualifications and pre-reqs,.....I like the position and feel that
I could contribute

immediately.

 Let's keep in touch, Chris!  Thanks for calling me!

   Sincerely,......Alain

Please create a manual invoice to MCV for the following item

Delivery Period Mar-02
Deal #332163
Contract 96001636
Volume 5000 x 31 days = 155,000
Price  $2.46
Pipeline  PEPL.
Location  Anadarko Pool.


The total amount should be $381,300.00.  Let me know if I missed something.

The Panhandle item for March 2002 is pathed but it's not passing through to settlements.  I'm not sure who to call about this.  

Louis, this is Phil and I have come up with on the A/R balance.  Now this doesn't mean that we have sent out everything - its always possible that an invoice was never created even though everything looks ok in the trading and scheduling systems.  Our March 2002 Panhandle item is a good example.

Amount			Comment		
$1,058,352.31		A/R Balance as of 5/9/02

   $472,171.50		April 2002 activity

     $26,143.85		This is part of the $381,300.00 manual invoice that Max will send out.  I believe MCV has agreed to pay this but only after we bill them.
     $17,942.80		Incorrect pricing for March 2002
   $384,975.00		MCV's replacement cost for MCV II that we did not serve in March 2002.  Ed needs to decide if MCV has the right to do this.  MCV
			support for this and the replacement prices seem reasonable.
   $429,061.65		1 To 30 day outstanding receivables

     $39,694.20		31 to 60 day outstanding receivables.  Pricing discrepancies for Feb 2002 production. We agree with MCV's pricing.

   $117,425.00		Remaining A/R balance after taking out the Current, 1 To 30, and 31 To 60 day aging items.

 I think that I agree with the points and comments you folks raised in the
first echange on indemnities below, but don't have the document to refer
to. Scott, please drop by and brief me on these.  Cognizant Gov't? Never
heard of  the term, and itis not one of the usual defined terms. Don't know
how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.

LOL ISSUES:
1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can
effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct
in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited
or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not
accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or
otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any
""to the fullest extent permitted by law"" clause or other  such stuff as a
compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.

2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity
for Haz Mat, patents, etc.

3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all
third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or
whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past. I
would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the larger
Enron is working it.  Please try it again if you can.

Subject:  GE Language

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Agree.
Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.
Here are the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Kay - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii)
(carve out of the 100% LOL for ""gross acts"" of its subcontractors, vendors,
ect.)?  GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely
and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its
subcontractors and vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers
simple negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that
we need to keep Section 27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence
of GE's subcontractors and vendors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the
phrase ""negligent or willfully wrongful"" is replaced with ""negligent, at
fault or strictly liable without fault"" (or some variation thereof).
What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with
MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to
also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails
to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is
ordered to shut down the facility.

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws,
patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase
price.
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another
party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.

Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call
to discuss our game plan.

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let
me know when, where, ect.

Kay

Hope all is well. 

Attached you will find an e-mail that I sent to Alan regarding ISDA 
documentation, for which I need approval from Houston.  Alan has informed me 
that he left you a voicemail on this subject and I was hoping you could 
provide me with guidance as to whom I should contact to obtain approval.

By separate e-mail, I will be forwarding weather derivative GTC's for use on 
EOL with Enron Japan Corp. as the Enron counterparty.  Please also advise who 
I should be in contact with to obtain the requisite approval for these GTC's, 
as well.

Best regards,

		 Subject: ISDA Documents 

Alan-

Attached hereto, are marked-up copies of the following ISDA documents (based 
on the US versions) which have been prepared using the credit worksheet for 
The Mitsui Marine & Fire Insurance Co., Limited, in conjunction with B&M:

ISDA Schedule,
CSA and
Enron Corp. Guarantee.

The footnotes will disappear when the changes to the document are accepted.  
It will be relatively straight forward to revise these for other 
counterparties
such as IBJ and Sanwa, which apparently have the same credit rating.  I note 
that we have not yet received the credit work sheet for IBJ or Sanwa.

Please note:

1.  There are still a number of ""options"" in the documents which I have not 
completed as I am unsure as to the desired outcome.  These are indicated in 
square
brackets.  Please let me know how you would like to deal with these;

2.   It will be important to make sure that the documents are carefully 
checked to ensure that we have properly incorporated the various elections in 
the documents;

3.   The agreements are governed by New York law and we should ensure that 
appropriate counsel reviews same;and

4.   A number of features in the agreements (particularly the requirement for 
a legal opinion and the use of L/Cs as form of collateral) are not common in
Japan and are likely to meet resistance from our counterparties.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

John

Subject: UPDATE ON QF DISCUSSIONS IN DC

Late Sat. night, the Principles Group met to  discuss the status of the 
overall progress made in various DC working  groups.? At that time, it was 
clear that a number of outstanding issues  remained unresolved, including the 
issue of ""credit worthiness"" going forward,  forbearance of past amounts due, 
and what program (if any) would resolve the  utilities' cash position while 
maintaining reliability.? Discussions are  continuing, and Tuesday is a 
critical deadline as the utilities (particulalry  SCE) has a large payment 
due that date.
?
The California legislature is developing  legislation to address some, or all 
the issues required, including we have heard  QF SRAC payment reform.
?
Regarding QF issues, reform of the QF energy  payments is viewed by many as a 
critical means to increase the utilities' cash  position.? While no 
resolution of that matter was reached as of end of day  Saturday, Governor 
Davis indicated during the Principles meeting that the CPUC  was going to 
render a decision on Thursday this week to address that  matter.? Most people 
inferred from this comment that the CPUC would take up  the Wood PD or some 
modification of that PD.? 
?
IEP believes that the approval of the Wood PD (or  an alternate) creates 
serious procedural questions and legal questions.? We  are drafting comments 
to the Wood PD which will be filed on Monday or Tuesday  which will address 
these issues.? In addition, Jan spoke during the  Principles Group meeting on 
Saturday, noting particularly that the Wood PD, if  voted out, would raise 
the spector of a significant amount of in-state  generation not able to 
operate, thereby raising significant reliability  concerns.
?
The QF working group addressing  modifications/reform of the existing SRAC 
payment structure was? not able  to reach consensus as of noon Sunday.? Talks 
are expected to continue with  the utilities on Monday, in San Francisco at 
11:00 a.m. at PG&E.? In  addition, given the signals from the governor and 
others, some QFs have  proceeded with bilateral discussions with their 
utility contract holders to work  out contract modifications/reforms on a 
bilateral basis.? 
?
[Note, I haven't yet checked all my emails, but I  believe we postponed the 
Friday Restructuring/Transmission conference call to  Monday, Jan 15 at 9:00 
a.m.? This will give us an opportunity to fully  brief you.

Don,

Below are additional questions and data requests regarding technical,
operational, and environmental aspects of the Wheatland project.  Please
respond to us at your earliest convenience.

Mario Hurtado
Duke Energy North America


            Duke Energy North America Additional Data Requests
                            Wheatland Facility

1.   [Wheatland] Please provide any and all studies related to the adequacy
of the plant's water supply.

2.   [Wheatland] During construction and commissioning of the plant and
switchyard were there any spills of oil or similar events that could have
resulted in soil or groundwater contamination?  Please provide details of
any incidents. Have there been any incidents since the plant achieved
commercial operation?  Please provide details.

3.   [Wheatland] It is our understanding that the switchyard will be owned
by the project and maintained by Cinergy.  Please provide a copy of the
proposed contract with Cinergy.  What indemnification will Cinergy provide
the project related to environmental incidents in the switchyard?

4.   [Wheatland] It is our understanding that the quality of the plant's
water supply in operation differed from the level assumed during
development.  Please provide all reports and documentation related to water
quality, including original design assumptions, testing during
commissioning, and problems as a result of quality differences.

5.   [Wheatland] Please provide a listing of all Enron affiliates involved
in the development and operation (physical and commercial) of the facility.
Such listing should include a one-sentence description of the role of the
entity, whether the role is terminated or continuing, and whether a formal
contract existed between the project and the entity.  [N.B.: We would like
to have this informaiton for Lincoln and Gleason as well.]

6.   [Wheatland] Please provide a listing of all non-Enron organizations
involved in the development, design, and construction of the facility who
may have a continuing relationship with the project, including outstanding
warranties, service contracts, as well as other rights and obligations.
Indicate how the organization was engaged, role of the organization and
whether there is any currently outstanding issues with the organization.

7.   [Wheatland] Are there any formal contracts between West Fork Land
Development Company and Lake Acquisition Company? Please provide.

8.   [Wheatland] Are there any currently enforceable warranties running
from the project to the EPC contractor (We understand it to be Enron
Engineering & Construction.) or NEPCO as subcontractor?

9.   [Wheatland] Please provide all engineering studies that discuss the
structural stability or integrity of the shoreline of the ""Lake"".  During
the site visit it was observed that one shoreline on one side of the Lake
had been reinforced.

10.  [Wheatland] Provide any studies discussing the seismic activity in the
vicinity of the Wheatland facility.

11.   [Wheatland] Were transmission upgrades required of Wheatland by
either Cinergy or IPL? Were transmission service credits credited to
Wheatland for the upgrades? Will these credits be transferred to the
Wheatland buyer?

12.  [Wheatland] Have any outages of the plant's interconnection occurred
as a result of high wind, blowing dust or lightning since commercial
operation?  If yes, how many incidents and for how long was the
interconnection out of service?

"

First off I hope your still not at work when I send this.

Secondly it would be cool to meet earlier in the week but I'm in San Antonio
and will be until Friday.  I will be driving to Houston on Friday morning to
do some packing and then the parents will be coming up on Saturday morning
to help with the final move.  I will pretty much leave it in your ball park
about Friday night.  I know you have been working long hours and Friday is
just a bad day.  Even though I would like to see you, if you have a repeat
of last week then I understand if you want to call it off.  In that case
maybe we can meet up some other time.  Although I do remember a girl telling
me once that weekends are her time and she was going to go out no matter
what.

Let me know what you think and I'll probably give you a call Friday
afternoon to see how things are going.

It was another great deposition day for the plaintiffs.? The high point was 
an audio taped phone conversation of Max Holmes' calling Stickler a liar.? A 
more detailed report is attached.

Frankly, I don't think McDonald and NatWest can let this case go to trial.? 
They will almost surely lose, and lose big, and PaineWebber could be drawn in 
too.? I think I will make a renewed pitch to Bruce MacLeod (Farallon's lawyer

Oil, Ethanol Industries Far From Deal
On Pending Senate Bill to Limit MTBE


Oil and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of 
the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), making it uncertain 
whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to 
craft an acceptable national
solution to the problem of MTBE in water, lobbyists told BNA April 17-19.

Despite fundamental differences, however, all sources interviewed for this 
story--including two oil industry officials, three ethanol advocates, and 
several other sources active in the legislative process on this issue--said 
that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying 
multiple interests could be developed.

""I don't think we're at an impasse,"" one oil industry official said, echoing 
comments by others in the debate. ""I just think it's going to take time."" 
Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this 
legislative session remains to be seen, this official and others said.

The committee chairman, Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), has made MTBE a priority, 
saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed 
by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality 
benefits associated with MTBE-mixed gasoline.

The chairman's view of the issue, however, is contrary to the view held by 
the Clinton administration, by ranking minority member Sen. Max Baucus 
(D-Mont.), and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the 
Senate. These forces hold that corn-derived ethanol and possibly other 
""renewable"" fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing 
the threat of MTBE water contamination.

The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view.

Smith Rejects 'Renewables' Linkage

When the Clinton administration announced on March 20 its support for a 
national renewable fuels mandate, Smith said ""the issue of renewable fuels 
has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water."" 
He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April 10.

In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates, several other interest groups 
maintain an active role in the ongoing debate, and Senate committee staff ar 
continuing behind-the-scenes meetings with all sides, sources said.

Generally, comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the 
additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely. A committee bill also 
is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act 
mandate currently driving the use of
MTBE and ethanol, another fuel oxygenate. At the same time, such a bill is 
expected to include ""no backsliding"" language to ensure that air toxics 
reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years 
are maintained even if states
waive out of the air act mandate.

Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief 
for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs.

Heavy Reliance on MTBE

MTBE is a high-oxygen, high-octane gasoline additive that is one of the most 
heavily produced chemicals in the United States. With roughly 12 million 
gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States, the 
chemical makes up more than 3 percent of gasoline by volume, according to the 
oil industry.

MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all 
""reformulated gasoline"" contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight. 
Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality. 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 80 percent of 
reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen 
requirement.

However, MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public 
water supplies, rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable. The 
health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known, but the chemical 
does taste and smell bad, according to a February report by the Congressional 
Research Service.

RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in 
their reformulated gasoline. Among other concerns in the legislative debate, 
the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the 2 
percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns, one 
industry representative said.

There were 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in 1999, 
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. USDA chief economist Keith 
Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April 11 that there are 
55 ethanol plants in operation in
""nearly 20 states.""

Bill Would Ease 2 Percent Oxygen Rule

To address water quality concerns, Smith has signed on to legislation (S. 
1886) that would allow states to lift the 2 percent mandate driving MTBE use.

Introduced by Inhofe and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), S. 1886 would not 
ban or phase down MTBE outright. However, this is expected to change when and 
if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive 
legislation, oil, ethanol, and other sources said.

""I think there's a growing set of opinion ... that MTBE either needs to be 
phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some 
years,"" an oil industry source said.

Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul 
of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination.

According to one source familiar with the issue, Senate committee staff 
members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns 
of MTBE interests. Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup 
costs is under consideration, as is the idea that MTBE makers should get 
expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical 
products.

In addition, the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of 
underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation, this 
source said.

Daschle, Harkin Drafts

At least 14 bills have been introduced in the 106th Congress to address the 
problem of MTBE in water, according to the Congressional Research Service 
report. The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act 
requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE.

Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agency's 
underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main 
cause of water contamination. This approach is supported by certain MTBE 
makers, who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and 
not by the high-quality fuel additive.

Additional draft bills are pending introduction, including comprehensive 
legislation by Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the Senate minority leader, that 
would significantly curtail MTBE use by 2004 while letting states take action 
before then.

Daschle's bill--said by Baucus's staff to be supported by the ranking EPW 
committee member--also would bolster ethanol production through a national 
renewable fuels mandate, expanding national average ethanol use to 2 percent 
or more over the next 10 years.

In addition, the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act 
to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs.

Ethanol supporter Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) also is drafting MTBE legislation 
that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senate's Easter recess, a 
spokeswoman said. Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard. ""If crafted in the right 
way,'' Harkin has said, such a standard ""could result in far more ethanol use 
than current law.""

Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity, 
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nebraska ranks third and 
Minnesota ranks fourth.

RFG Market

Despite calls for eliminating the 2 percent oxygenate requirement in the 
reformulated gasoline program, ethanol interests said they still support 
maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban.

Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void, doubling 
ethanol use over three to five years, sources said. If Congress were to 
eliminate the 2 percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels 
requirement, ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current 
levels. However, it would do so over a longer period of about 10 years, one 
ethanol source said.

Oil industry officials, as well as Northeast states and some environmental 
advocates, oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a ""de facto 
ethanol mandate."" The oil industry also continues to oppose a national 
renewable fuels standard, officials said.

A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April 11 that Smith 
appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests, considering a 
national average ""alternative fuel"" requirement that would benefit ethanol as 
well as natural gas, electricity, and other transportation fuels.

The Northeast representative, Jason Grumet of Northeast States for 
Coordinated Air Use Management, supports the national average, alternative 
fuel approach, since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without 
requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwest-derived ethanol.

However, oil company interests reaffirmed April 17 their long-held opposition 
to any new fuel mandates, saying concerns over MTBE in water should be 
addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting 
any new mandates.

Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural 
states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections, a 
second oil industry official said. It is not simply that the industry opposes 
new mandates--though that is
the case--but also that an ethanol-mandate ""bidding war"" might erupt in a 
year when  Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes, the 
official said.

Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion

Meanwhile, ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion 
of their product in the RFG market, and do not necessarily see a national 
renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise.

The Clinton administration's renewable standard would require ethanol use 
initially at current levels of about 1.2 percent of gasoline. The mandate 
would then expand over 10 years, administration officials have said.

Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE, making it more difficult for oil refiners 
to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for 
volatile organic compounds. This is one reason the ""de facto mandate"" is 
opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests. Some of the 
renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to 
meet requirements over an annual average, enabling them to avoid or reduce 
their ethanol use in summer.

No Markup Scheduled

Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil, ethanol, environmental, 
MTBE, and state interests continue. A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE 
legislation ""is something we're trying to get done quickly,"" but that a bill 
markup has not been scheduled.

Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE 
legislation are important to the legislative process, sources said, because a 
bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from 
Democrats and Republicans on the committee, as well as from members of the 
Senate Agricultural Committee.

""I just can't see this getting duked out on the floor,"" said one ethanol 
lobbyist. ""I think that we, the MTBE folks, the oil company folks, and the 
environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on 
the floor.""

According to one source, a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE 
use down to pre-1990 levels over about four years. Before the 1990 air act 
amendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline, MTBE was used mainly 
to enhance octane.

It is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both 
Democrats and Republicans, ethanol and oil interests, as well as to Northeast 
states, the Midwest, and California.

""Things change day to day,"" an oil industry official said. ""I think the issue 
could be resolved without the ethanol piece, but the ethanol piece is just so 
difficult,"" he added.

""I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere 
with solid footing,"" an ethanol industry source said."

Joe,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are inviting Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would 
appreciate if you could
speak, together with Kevin and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is 
important for a group
of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to 
understand the big picture.

I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.

   A new book that says men may beat their wives has caused an outcry in
Turkey.
   The Guardian newspaper reports that ""The Muslim's Handbook,"" written by
retired cleric Kemil Gubran, advised men not to hit too hard and to avoid
the face. It also said that if a man's wife is ill and he can't afford a
servant, he could take a second wife.
   The book was published by the state-funded Pious Foundation, which is
affiliated with Turkey's religious directorate. In the past decade, the
directorate -- which appoints Muslim clerics and dictates topics for
mosques -- has been presenting a modern interpretation of Islam to include
expanded roles and rights for women.
   ""I am outraged that such a book was published with state funds, with
money women paid in taxes,"" said Zuhal Krilic, the head of Kader, a group
promoting women in politics.
   A book published in Spain several weeks ago also said a Muslim man could
beat his wife -- and included tips and instructions -- although it
counseled that the best way to bring a woman in line was through verbal abuse.

0,"Bill,
 
To get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet).  Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows.  She is completely independent from the hotel and I'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has.  They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket.  It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see.  I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now.  You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead.  Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town.
 
Rent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first .
 
I agree with John, your best hotel bet is the Marriott Marquis, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best.
 
Don't forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast!
 
Keep us posted.

Gosh, that sounds great!
 
It's been more than 5 years since we've been to NYC, but here's what I'd do...this weekend, look around BR (that's Baton Rouge) for the Sunday issue of the New York Times.  Look in the Lifestyle section (or the NYT equivalent) and you'll undoubtedly see ads for weekend specials and/or package deals to the city, possibly including airfare, hotel, theater tickets, meals, airport transfers, etc.
 
Other than that, you can check out the Marriott Marquis Hotel, which has its own theater and may offer special weekend rates.  Don't gasp when you find out that a room is going to run you $200/night ++, that's just the going rate for a very expensive city.
 
You'll need to visit the TKTS booth in Times Square, where folks queue up mid-morning for half-priced same-day tickets to some great shows...and some real dogs.  You won't find any Producers tickets there, unfortunately, but Rent may be available.  See Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables, for sure.
 
Grab lunch at the Carnegie Deli, but don't fall on the floor when you order the $18 reuben sandwich.  Pay the $3 split fee and share it with Teri.  Note the huge desserts and the terse wait staff.
 
See if the Rainbow Room is still open for dinner and dancing.  Kim and I celebrated our 10th anniversary there with Mike & Cheryl Pope (it was Cheryl's 40th BD, too).  The Rainbow Room is in Rockefeller Center (where NBC is located).
 
Everything is going to be expensive, so get used to it.

The following message and attachements are from Brian Hiebert:

Enclosed for your review and comment is both a clean copy and a blacklined 
draft of the proposed form of Asset Purchase Agreement prepared by the 
solicitors for the receiver, KPMG.

I have taken that agreement and redrafted it to provide for direct 
representations and warranties from the Banks to Enron regarding such issues 
as title, status of contracts, financial statements, and otherwise.

This agreement should be viewed as a preliminary draft only as I did not have 
the benefit of reviewing the schedules which will form part of the 
agreement.  I understand those schedules are being prepared and will be 
forwarded to us together with a possibly revised version of this agreement.  
Also coming over is a form of debt purchase agreement.

Once I have received those agreements and have had an opportunity to review 
them together with their schedules I expect further changes will result.  
Further changes may also result from the continuation of due diligence 
through the course of this week and next.

However, I think the enclosed is a dramatic improvement from Enron's 
perspective over the form of purchase and sale agreement proposed by KPMG.

I look forward to discussing this with you.  In the meantime, if you have any 
questions please feel free to give me a call.

today.  We both found it to be of considerable value.  Dana and I are already 
kicking around some ideas on how we can think about EOTT's future 
profitability growth in 
a much bolder, creative and innovative manner.  One of our approaches will be 
to add a couple of individuals to our team that will assist us in identifying 
unique opportunities and new approaches to our business.  We will keep you

""What's Real About Real Options"" 


Tuesday April 24th 2001
6:30 PM
Wells Fargo Room
Haas School of Business
UC Berkeley


Refreshments will be served
?
------------------------------------------------------------------  About the 
talk  By Jacob Sagi, Assistant Professor of Finance, Haas School of Business

 Martha Amram is one of the leading advocates of the real options approach to 
asset  valuation. The methodology originated as an economically sound way to  
calculate the value of an asset whose management requires sequential  
decision-making. For instance, a pharmaceutical company may wish to assess  
the value of a speculative research project that, after many stages, may  
result in a marketable drug. At each stage the company can decide to proceed  
along a number of routes: abandoning the project, moth balling it, or  
continuing on a variety of scales. Roughly speaking, the real options  
approach selects, from among a universe of possible sequential decision  
strategies, a single strategy that maximizes the present value of cash  
flows. The cash flows for each strategy are discounted for the risk that the  
strategy reflects and not by an ad hoc cost of capital discount factor.

A real options approach to valuation is especially useful when one is trying  
to decide whether to defer investment in a project (analogous to deciding  
whether an American Call option should be exercised), or when an asset  
embodies latent value due to future growth possibilities (e.g., internet  
firms). Although academicians have long been proponents of the technique,  
there is still a great deal of skepticism among practitioners. This is  
largely due to the fact that ""optimal"" decisions reached via a real options  
approach are sensitive to input variables that are not always known reliably  
(e.g., the probability that a drug will be deemed successful in human  
trials). Regardless, a growing number of firms are opting for the  
methodology. This is evidenced by an increase in the number of consulting  
firms who employ or specialize in real options analyses.

Tuesday's speaker, Martha Amram, is the author of an important book on the  
subject, ""Real Options: Managing Strategic Investments in an Uncertain  
World,"" as well as recent articles in the Journal of Business Strategy,  
Harvard Business Review and Journal of Applied Corporate Finance. She has  
extensive consulting experience and is frequently invited to speak on the  
subject of real options. Although some in the business community have  
recently branded real options valuations a fad, academicians, like myself,  
would contend that the methodology is an important tool that is here to  
stay. I therefore encourage all students to come to the talk and learn more  
about the advantages and disadvantages of this much-talked-about concept.

Guy,

Your intent for the conference calls was right. We need to have a dialog with these parties like we do with the rest of our structured suppliers. But it must be a coordinated effort. There was no need to cancel the calls. Please coordinate to reestablish the conference calls with these contacts and for any others you may have, please contact  the following people as they are directly responsible for customer coverage and structured supply in their respective regions. We appreciate your efforts and like ComEd and AEP, I am sure we will continue to work closely.

0,"Today's Washington Post reports on an interview with FERC commissioners Wood 
and Massey following yesterday's hearing before the Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee.  According to the Post, each commissioner said they are 
prepared to make ""heavy refunds"" because of overcharging in California.  They 
each said they agreed to give the parties a chance to work it out in the 
upcoming settlement conference first.  The Post article (which was on the 
front page of the business section, perhaps an indication of the somewhat 
diminished press coverage of the issue) mentioned Enron in a list of 
companies ""facing allegations of overcharges.""

There are also news reports that Gov. Davis met with commissioners Wood and 
Brownell while he was in town.  The same reports say that Gov. Davis will 
meet with commissioner Wood in California on  Monday."

in excess of 1500 deals.  If you guys need this field covered,  we need to

Subject: EOL Broker Clean Up

Jeff,

I am attaching a list of EOL transactions that we need your help ""cleaning 
up"".  With the new Broker-Client application that EOL is bringing on this 
weekend, we need to remove EOL from the broker field.  What we have run into 
is:  there are many deals in Tagg that have EOL in the broker field but no 
EOL number.  We are requesting that risk go through and add the EOL deal 
number to the tagg legs where there is none listed.  The reason for this is 
that if we remove EOL from the broker field and there is no EOL deal number 
reference, then there is no way to no if that deal is an EOL deal.  For audit 
purposes, no one could tie back to the deals.  

Please give this list to the appropriate risk groups (by index).  Let me know 
if you have any further questions.  ALSO, this list is in addition to the 
list that I provided Errol yesterday.

Thank you,
Dawn

0,"On sunday we had a problem with PSCO, they tried to back out of a purchase from El Paso since they claimed they were picking up the power at the FC 230 bus instead of the 345 bus.  Also there is an issue with the schedule being until further.  This once again highlights our need to be as clear as possible on ALL aspects of the deals that we do.  All new people should have a discussion with myself or another senior member as to the differences between the FC's busses, N. Gila vs. Devers and other points on the grid that you are unsure of.

Dear Sara:

I apologize for the delay but I have been unsuccessful in finding a good way
to get you your wine.  I am unable to ship FedEx or UPS unless it is going
to a distributor.  We have some customers who live in similar ""unfriendly""
wine states who make arrangements with private mailing companies here in
California and we have mailed it to them.  Unfortunately, the danger in us
doing it is it could get held up somewhere along the way and they may
destroy it.  I believe it is too much wine to risk the possibility.

I will continue to look into other possibilities but if you have any
suggestions or are planning to be in another state soon, please let me know
and I will do whatever I can to get it to you.

Regards,


Jill Melendy

Subject: Summary of HB 2107

The Texas statute allows for full collection of stranded costs with a final 
determination of stranded costs in 2004 and interim collection in 2002 and 
2003 based on a Commission estimate.  The Commission bases its estimate of 
stranded costs on the ECOM (Excess Costs Over Market) Model.  The ECOM model 
computes the difference between the revenues a utility would receive in a 
regulated environment versus the revenues a utility would receive if it sold 
all of its generation at market prices (the market price in the ECOM Model is 
based on a Combined Cycle Combustion Turbine). 

In 1998 the Commission estimated more than $4 Billion in stranded costs based 
on the ECOM Model.  Because stranded costs are the difference between the 
market value and the book value of utility generating assets, the Commission 
ordered utilities to ""mitigate"" stranded costs by increasing depreciation of 
generating assets.  The accelerated depreciation, came from two sources:

 1. Redirected depreciation -- Utilities were allowed to defer depreciation 
of their wires assets and increase depreciation on generating assets; and,
 2. Application of Excess Earnings -- instead of decreasing utility rates the 
Commission set a cap on earnings and directed the utilities to apply any 
earnings above the cap to depreciating generating assets.

Because of the unexpected rise in natural gas prices the market price in the 
ECOM model rose significantly above the weighted average price of the 
regulated side which is weighted by coal and nuclear.  This caused the 2001 
estimate of stranded costs to be severely negative.  Even more negative than 
the amounts of redirected depreciation and application of excess earnings.

Enron argued at the Commission that because the estimate of stranded cost was 
negative the accelerated depreciation was unnecessary.  Consequently, we 
argued that the money spent on mitigation should be used to reduce wires 
rates.  The utilities argued that they should keep mitigation until the final 
determination of stranded costs in 2004.  The Commission ruled in Enron's 
favor.  

Sylvester Turner filed H.B. 2107 to address this situation, however, rather 
than simply reducing wires charges, the bill as filed would reduce utility 
rates making it more difficult to compete.  We are working to amend the bill 
so that the credit for redirected depreciation and excess earnings goes only 
to reducing wires rates and that any negative stranded costs beyond that 
amount would be refunded directly to ratepayers.

0,"El Paso announced changes to its pipeline cleaning and internal inspection 
program. Line 1100 between Eunice and Pecos River Stations will be smart 
pigged Sunday (postponed one day), causing a 200 MMcf/d flow reduction 
through Eunice to the South Mainline. Six interconnects will not be able to 
deliver into El Paso for 10 hours that day. Another smart pigging of Line 
1100 between Pecos River and Guadalupe Stations will occur Nov. 22 (also 
postponed one day), requiring a reduction of 200 MMcf/d through Pecos River. 
Line 1203 (Maricopa Line) pigging will be done Nov. 21-24, reducing the 
line's capacity by 60 MMcf/d and affecting deliveries of San Juan gas to the 
Phoenix area. Line 3222 pigging will be done Nov. 30 and Dec. 19, causing a 
100 MMcf/d allocation. Line 3201 pigging will be done Dec. 2 and 20, causing 
a 150 MMcf/d allocation. The allocations will affect points upstream of 
Bondad Mainline and Gallup. "

0,"As you may have heard, we are in the process of building a business to make 
markets in credit protection and are getting close to launching where we will 
quote both directions on many of the credits in our existing portfolio in 
addition to names in non-energy industries.  It is important from both a 
commercial and legal perspective to ensure that we do not have what could be 
considered a fiduciary responsibility with the credits that we are making 
prices on.  The initial set of reference credits has been sent to credit and 
legal for approval and then will be forwarded to origination for further 
approval before we initiate coverage.  Pls. take a look at the names and let 
us know if you have any problems with us quoting prices on them.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns

Since I did not see FX trades excluded, I presume that we can confirm FX 
trades and options under this master.  Please let me know.  Thanks"
0,"Greg,

My brother is looking to make a career change from teaching (currently a biology teacher at Richland High School) into something where performance is rewarded.

He is an extremely hard worker who is ultra competitive.  Do you have any needs for entry level hourly guys?   I think he could learn the business quick and do well in our industry.

I know there is a ton of market uncertainty in the West right now with the California debacle, so I'm not sure if you need people or not.  Let me know if there is any chance for an interview and I can have my brother send a resume.

Hope everything is going well for you and your family.

Thanks."

0,"Hi Dan:

Just an update to let you know the status of the agreements between Reliant
and Enovate and Enron.  They are both being routed internally prior to
execution.  However, due to the ""Notices"" section missing from the Enovate
contract, Legal has asked that I forward that to you for execution prior to
Reliant's execution.  I hope that this is not a problem.

Dan, I don't want this contract to get misdirected, Enron's so large and
that could easily happen.  Could you please send me your direct mailing
address so that I may send it directly to you for your further handling?
Thanks, I appreciate so much your help in getting these two agreements
completed.

YOu can either call me or email me your direct mailing address and I'll
send you the Enovate contract as soon as I receive it.

Thank you,

0,"Larry, my understanding is that ESA has taken four units and that Janet 
Dietrich in conversations with ESA has made four more available to ESA 
subject to them getting their deal approved by the board.  So I do not 
believe Enron needs to committ to additional LM units at this time.

Subject: ESA's LM 6000's

Guys, although I am hesitant to get in between ESA and ENA on this issue, my 
perception is that there is some confusion; we need to sort out at the top.  
Let me describe what I understand of the facts.  

First, ESA is coordinating a DASH through the RAC for eight LM 6000's.

Second, ENA has a list of 24 LM 6000's; the ""ready to ship date"" as shown on 
the following attachment; but only four of these are earmarked for ESA, as 
far as I understand.

Third, GE/S&S has approached me and is willing to sell us more LM 6000's if 
we need to.  The ""ready to ship dates"" for these new LM 6000's are between 
January - March, 2001.  We could possibly get these at the current preferred 
pricing (as a current contract change order).

ESA and ENA should discuss whether or not either party wants to buy some of 
the new LM 6000's that are now available for delivery between January - 
March, 2001.  Does ENA want to substitute any of these for LM 6000's 
currently on hand and not allocated to ESA?  Is ENA earmarking four 
additional LM 6000's on the attached list to ESA, and if so, which ones?  If 
not, does ESA want EECC to secure any or all of the remaining units required, 
which we can do quickly, off the balance sheet.

My perception is that there is confusion and not clear direction, I recommend 
that both of you have a discussion and establish a clear definition of what 
we are doing with the LM 6000's and whether either of you want to entertain 
the purchase of the new LM 6000's.  Let me know if I can help.

From our contact with the Governor's office, seems that Kari Dohn, formerly

Subject: Top Level Energy Person
Importance: High

Greetings Tom, in preparation for our upcoming Board of Governors' meeting,
I would like to ask you for your help in getting a speaker for the evening.
The March 11 (Sunday) Board meeting in Sacramento is focused around CSU
Legislative Day scheduled for Monday, March 12.  The Board meeting is
scheduled to begin at 4:00 pm followed by a dinner.  We will invite the CSU
Trustees to attend the dinner along with other key CSU leaders; we normally
have about 30-40 individuals attend the dinner.

This year, we would like to invite someone from the Governor's office to
come and talk a little about the energy crises in California.  Can you help
us identify someone in Davis' administration that may be interested in
speaking to this distinguished group of individuals?

Again, briefly,
Meeting date/time:  Sunday, March 11, 2001 at 4:00 pm; dinner is scheduled
for 6:45pm; in Sacramento.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

revised to reflect the latest Clifford Chance drafts and our discussion 
yesterday.  We are unable to blackline these drafts, due to the fact that the 
Clifford Chance drafts are not on our system (and we did not receive all of 
them in any event).  Also, we have not yet received from Mark's office the 
language on confirmations; we have taken a shot at it but can obviously 
modify it after we get the language.

Finally, we have attached a blackline of the ""Legal and Privacy"" statement, 
reflecting some suggested changes.  We also note that, if this document is to 
be ""global"", we will either need to decide on a single governing law or 
delete choice of law entirely.

 Wall Street enthusiasm and a growing list of brand-name clients have 
legitimized content distribution as a business, putting two
 companies that started it all - Akamai Technologies and Sandpiper Networks - 
into the spotlight.

 Digital Island's $630 million acquisition of Sandpiper last week and 
Akamai's $2.2 billion pre-initial public offering valuation are likely
 to make merger and acquisition artists wonder how much their company would 
be worth with the inclusion of a Sandpiper or
 Akamai. Akamai, which priced it shares at $26, saw its stock hit $125.50 in 
midday trading Oct. 29.

 Digital Island, the San Francisco-based Web hosting shop that was worth $1.2 
billion on Oct. 25 when it announced the Sandpiper
 acquisition, saw its market capitalization gain $1 billion in the course of 
four days.

 Why are the services of Akamai and Sandpiper so valuable all of a sudden? 
The Internet can't deliver Web - much less broadband -
 content fast enough, and network backbone companies are taking too long to 
solve the bottleneck puzzle, industry experts said.

 ""We looked at content sites A through Z, and 52 percent of them are planning 
to buy content delivery services next year,"" said Greg
 Howard, principal analyst and owner of the HTRC Group, a market research 
company.

 With customers that eager to show service providers the money, many are 
scrambling to deliver.

 In a space where a year ago Sandpiper was a lone evangelist and Akamai a 
rocket from nowhere, new content distributors are
 popping up like mushrooms.

 Adero, Edgix and Mirror Image are three companies that are gaining mindshare 
in the market. Since at the core of a content
 distribution system lies a massive task managing hundreds and eventually 
thousands of caches operated as one network, such
 companies as iBeam Broadcasting and SkyCache are also gaining credibility in 
the market.

 And then there are a few sudden entrants. Enron Communications and Exodus 
Communications are trying to amend existing
 business models to take advantage of the new opportunity.

 How big is the opportunity? The content distribution market, Howard said, 
will grow from $62 million this year to $306 million next
 year, and to about $2.3 billion in 2002.

 Acquisition as an exit strategy is certainly something new content 
distributors are thinking about.

 ""I think it's hard to say what will happen in this industry next. All 
business models are very different,"" said Rangu Salgame, president
 and chief executive of Edgix. ""I think we will stand independent - for a 
while.""

 Potential buyers include any given content provider - from CNN Interactive 
to Pets.com - that writes three checks every month: one
 for bandwidth, one for Web hosting and, lately, one for content 
distribution. These groups have the most to gain from content
 delivery services, executives said.

 ""There are a couple of likely players in this space. One, there are new 
start-ups like Adero and specialized content distributors like
 Intervu; two, there are colocation providers like Exodus; and three, there 
are traditional telcos like MCI WorldCom, who are
 standing on the sidelines right now, but have a lot of edges for content to 
reside on,"" said Leo Spiegel, president and CEO of
 Sandpiper, soon to be Digital Island.

 What would happen if any given company were to buy all three components?

 ""This would mean running content distribution through a single network and 
maintaining a global footprint,"" Howard said. ""It is hard,
 but doable.""

 There are reasons why the network-content distributor combination could 
backfire. Akamai executives declined interviews for this
 story due to the Securities and Exchange Commission-imposed quiet period. 
But in the past, they have been vocal about a single
 network scenario being untenable for content distribution because their 
business model is predicated on carrier neutrality. This is why
 Internet service providers and telephone companies are open to content 
distributors colocating servers within their networks.

 Another possible exit strategy for content distributors is to sell out to 
large media companies such as America Online, Disney and
 Time Warner. These companies could maintain the content distributors' 
""Switzerland"" status and still use the service as a competitive
 advantage by speeding up content delivery, industry watchers said.

Number 17, August 2001
Negotiation In Emotional Circumstances

Our website's advice section gets questions on a wide
variety of topics from all over the world.  Recently a
web visitor posed a question that many of us face. 
Often as our own children are establishing themselves
as adults, we're faced with issues relating to care for
older relatives.

Here's our reader's question and our response:

Convincing Elders To Accept Care

Question: As a hospital/geriatric social worker, both
in my personal and work life I am frequently asked the
following question:  ""My elderly [parent, aunt,
neighbor...] clearly needs some help at home, but
refuses this help [even if free, or done by a family
member, a church...].  How can I convince this person
to accept help?""

After I've determined that the issue isn't financial
(usually a solvable problem), then I am frequently at a
loss.  The situations I've seen like this seem to only
resolve after a crisis occurs, and the person has no
choice. 

How would you approach a situation like this?  The
issues seem to revolve around pride, retaining control,
denial of illness, aging or disability...  Any
thoughts?

Response: In his 'Notes From The Underground',
Dostoevsky wrote, ""Human behavior is motivated by the
craving for absolute freedom and self-assertion in
defiance of all dictates of reason.""  As decrepitude
takes its toll on our bodies -- and minds -- often
pride is the only thing we have left.

Waiting for a crisis is excruciating for folks who
think of themselves as caregivers when it comes to
organizing care for people who have less and less
capacity to take care of themselves or their personal
surroundings.

Probably the wisest thing to do is ask a whole lot of
questions.  Using the example of children of an elderly
parent, first the concerned children need to ask
themselves what are their own interests.  Do they want
to assuage guilt?  Do they fear that harm will come to
their parent?  Are they concerned that a crisis will
interrupt the normal course of their own lives?

Questions also need to be asked of the parent: What
most concerns you about your situation -- health,
comfortable surroundings, companionship, your capacity
to hold your head up and say, ""Daughter please! I can
do it myself!""  One can also ask, ""What do you think
are the standards that determine one's capacity to live
an independent life?""

This questioning approach brings the parties into
fuller participation in the decision-making process. 
When I ask you a question it means I am taking you
seriously; the reverse is equally true.  In
negotiation, this technique is called Active Listening.

The crucial element is listening closely to all the
elements of the responses to those questions, both the
questions one asks oneself and the questions asked of
other people.  It is no less important to respond to
what people say by checking to make sure you've
understood their points; you may want to say, ""This is
what I understood you to have said; is my understanding
correct?""  You also want to indicate, ""The fact that I
understand what you have said does not necessarily mean
I agree with you.""

Clinging on to the visual indicators of independence is
a critical vital sign.  The fear of loving relatives
that something bad can happen has to be balanced
against the knowledge that if you kick someone in their
self-esteem, you are attacking a most vulnerable part
of their anatomy.  You cannot negotiate away a person's
self-esteem, but you can destroy it through frontal and
flanking attacks.

The frustration faced by folks who see loved ones
failing to take proper care of themselves is
phenomenal.  Very often the people who have advocated
professional care ultimately must mutter (hopefully to
themselves) the unsatisfying statement, ""I told you
so.""

In your question you indicate that crisis forces
choice.  Perhaps the best approach is to prepare a
safety net that is ready when the crisis occurs.  It
cannot prevent a crisis from happening; and it is
crucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened by
forcing the 'victim' of it to lose face. But having
that safety net ready can at least reduce the force of
the fall.

Relationship is one of the seven most significant
issues to consider in negotiation.  Focusing on the
relationship with an elderly parent or friend, not
letting decrepitude get in the way of love and caring
can make it much easier when someone's self-esteem is
attacked by a crisis.  Looking at oneself and saying,
""It's not my fault,"" is not a way of avoiding blame,
but rather giving a loved one the freedom to make their
own mistakes -- just as they did the first time they
gave us the keys to the car.

Clemmons final will go today. 

Do we need to talk about Josey and Thompson?

"
0,"This is from PIRA.  There stuff is usually quite good.  To go farther back 
than '98 would require special work on their part.  The person at PIRA 
basically indicated that such data would come straight from the WSCC/NERC.  
So that really leaves the WSCC suggestion as being the only viable one if you 
want a long-term view.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""twea=
ks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

0,"     Steve,

      1.  With apologies, attached is the redrafted petition, removing the ""excessive heat"" allegation.

       2.  You told me that the only way to perhaps determine if other Baytank entities were involved was to ask Philchem, who might or might not know, and who would then be asking questions about what we were going to do next.

       Britt

	 

     P.S. to Richard:  I haven't heard back from Baytank's president, even though I left a voice-mail and sent an e-mail, which was shown on my e-mail receipts as having been read on Tuesday of this week.  In the e-mail, I specifically said that we may be filing suit this week if we didn't get an extension.

	For the sake of caution, I think we need to file suit Friday afternoon, for reasons I've mentioned previously.  Shouldn't I send out a GC memo now?

	Steve,

	Per your advice, I have removed the ""excessive heat"" allegation in the petition.  How does it look to you now?

	Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  You confirmed that while we know for sure that the contamination didn't occur prior to October 28, and that it was discovered on or about November 4, we don't know for an absolute certainty that it didn't occur, say, on October 29, 1999.  Accordingly, if Baytank won't grant us an extension of time to file suit against it (and you, Richard and Jim were bcc'd on the e-mail I just sent to the president of some Baytank entity asking for such an extension), then I want to be ready to file this suit on Friday.

	A related point:  I have included the name of the Baytank entity with whom Philchem executed the Marketing Agreement, which is the only Baytank corporate entity that I know of that had some responsibility for the contamination.  However, the Marketing Agreement does not say whether that Baytank entity owns, leases or operates the facilities in question.  It would be preferable to name any and all Baytank entites that own, lease or operate the facility in question.  Short of calling Baytank and asking, do you know how we could find this out very quickly?

	Many thanks.

	Britt

	P.S.:  Richard,  should I go ahead and send out a GC memo on this suit, in case Baytank doesn't promptly respond to my request for an extension of time?  "

Hey Chris,

 It is deal number 348443 that is set up as a sale (for Aug. - Nov.) to 
Clinton Gas Marketing and should be Clinton Energy Management.  I couldn't 
find the other supply numbers that you were asking about...  Could you get 
this changed in the system to reflect Clinton Energy Management?  Thanks...

Thanks for getting people together. There are (at least) 3 things going on here:

1) Coordinate PG&E/SCE
2) Edison ""meet and confer"" (on Monday?  sez Williams) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th.
3) Edison meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder's coordinating.

2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.  It is critical that gov't affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.  No finger pointing, but our litigation strategy with edison thus far has been wanting.

We have a number yet for the call?

Harris  give their commercial updates.  We intend to have both Dave and Steve 
give their presentations from last week's KeyEx customer meeting plus some 
updates as to current  revenue levels etc.

We do not intend to show the KeyEx videotapes at these  employee meetings.  
However, we will make available to each of you, a copy of the  meeting 
videotape to share with your employees at satff meetings or to let them 
review it as time permits.
I will assume one copy is sufficient unless I hear otherwise.  Mike Nelson, I

Good morning Vince,

Christie has suggested that I be the liaison for John Martin and your 
research project 'Enron - Case Study of a Company Reinventing Itself'.  

In John's lastest email, he suggested that the first week of December works 
with his schedule - up to December 6th - or the following couple of weeks 
after Dec. 8th.  Do these dates work for you as well?  If so, I will proceed 
in booking one hour sessions with the following Enron management:

Ken Lay
Jeff Skilling
Andy Fastow

If these dates do not work for you let me know when you are available and I 
will try to coordinate with John, Jeff, Ken and Andy.  Also, I will send an 
introductory email to John.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you,

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence.

Dear Tanya,

Thank you very much for the offer.

Basically, I can start at anytime if the condition is acceptable.

Currently I'm in the middle of a decision that I can extend my internship or
accept a job offer at here. But I think that decision should be done soon
since my original internship expires this week. So the exact time to start
work at Enron depends on how quickly I can get your official offer including
employment condition.

I hope this will help to your question. If you have any question on me, please
feel free to contact me.

Again, I appreciate your decision.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

Subject: FW: First flat rate out of the chute = Tenderland



Orange County/State briefs: Truckee firm offers cut-rate electricity

August 16, 2000

Orange County Register

A Truckee company is selling electricity for 8 cents per kilowatt hour, far
less than what many south Orange County residents have been paying this
summer. TenderLand Power Co. will guarantee the flat rate for a year,
starting Oct. 1, for up to 60,000 customers. That equates to roughly 5
percent of all the customers now using San Diego Gas & Electric Co.

This week, SDG&E is selling electricity for 17.6 cents per kilowatt hour.

Residents may want to wait before switching, because a cut in SDG&E bills
could be in the offing, said Jodi Beebe at the Utility Consumers' Action
Network in San Diego.

TenderLand Invites 60,000 Electricity Customers to Opt Out of Electric Rate
Crisis

08/15/2000

Business Wire

(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

TRUCKEE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 15, 2000--TenderLand Power Company
has invited 60,000 California electricity customers on a first-come,
first-served basis to choose TenderLand, receive a flat electric generation
rate, and stand up for their right under deregulation to switch away from
San Diego Gas & Electric, thereby completely opting out of the rate crisis
being experienced by SDG&E customers.

In response to the high electric rates in San Diego, the California
Legislature as well as the California Public Utilities Commission has
proposed laws and procedures which create a deferred payment plan disguised
as a lower, or ""frozen"" fixed electric rate plan. The proposed directives
may require even those electric customers who switch or plan to switch from
SDG&E to pay for the costs of this ""electric rate loan"" whether or not they
receive their power from an alternative electric service provider like
TenderLand. Clearly, such a situation would infringe upon the rights of
electric ratepayers participating in a deregulated electricity market, as
they may still be forced to pay added costs for expensive energy purchased
by their local electricity distribution utility (like SDG&E) and consumed by
the utility's own customers.

""TenderLand views this possible situation as unfair to ratepayers who have
benefited by deregulation and exercised their right to choose, or plan to
choose an alternative electric service provider,"" said TenderLand Chief
Financial Officer Ken Keddington. ""TenderLand is committed to taking all
possible action to protect its customers from these possible additional
costs while providing a renewable energy option.""

""When California electricity customers choose TenderLand to receive
renewable power at a true flat electric generation rate, they will also join
TenderLand's crusade against passing added costs to those who want to opt
out of the statewide electric rate crisis, especially noticeable in San
Diego, by switching to alternative electric service providers.""

The flat rate offer is limited to the first 60,000 new residential and
commercial customers who sign up with TenderLand. For more information, call
toll free at: 877/872-0932, or sign up on TenderLand's website at
www.TenderLand.com.

TenderLand Power Company, Inc. provides its customers with 100% renewable
power and is committed to furthering the development of new renewable
generation nationwide. The company is headquartered in Truckee, Calif.,
began retail operations in April 1999, and serves customers throughout most
of California.

DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

0,"Dear Mechelle,

Although I am still somewhat confused about goals and deliverables of the 
model project that we discussed last week, I thought I would share some 
information with you that may help you better scope this project.  As I 
currently understand it, AA wants to ensure that all databases, spreadsheets 
etc are inventoried.

Currently, risk management is incharge of setting up curves and books in the 
source systems. We are responsible for setting up the relevant curve/book in 
RisktRAC.  We have no access to the source systems. We are changing this 
process by: 

Instead of being inserted in the middle of the process we are working with IT 
to transfer over the responsibility of establishing curves and books in the 
source systems to ourselves.  At the moment we are concentrating on ERMS, 
then will work with EnPower, and lastly, exotic spreadsheets.
We are developing a process to validate all new curves the day they are 
created.
Our global exception reporting captures books & deals that do not make it 
into any of the VAR, credit, or DPR.
An inventory of active books in the RAC website (which all risk management 
personnel have access to) is being created.  This is a short term fix until 
the counterparty book library initiative can meet our needs (not before 
March).
We are putting a tool together to track all of the book requests. 

I'll keep you updated on our progress.  

Best regards

0,"1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project.

Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on 
schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.  
PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of 
separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon 
tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not 
create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, 
according to PG&E, are in place.

PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to 
discuss maintenance issues with ET&S.

Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. 
pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or 
disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E 
will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or 
dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has 
indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce 
costs associated with cleaning the pipe.

2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. 

Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at 
MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round 
of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples 
collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to 
be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels 
north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing 
showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has 
been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be 
collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant 
to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is 
considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.

Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The 
gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas 
Co.  system which is PCB free.

3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. 

West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system 
has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these 
locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to 
have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the 
sampling program.  
Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs 
under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the 
pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the 
bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By 
increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.

It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the 
separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.

4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.

Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter 
separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The 
determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) 
a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of 
the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.
Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) 
have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern 
River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have 
shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this 
location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that 
there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume 
of gas deliveries.

PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional 
filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer 
load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection 
at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express 
additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.

5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.

 a. Siting, Design and Engineering

 b. Cost Estimates 

PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus 
an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next 
week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter 
separators may be proposed for installation.  

The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 
indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have 
not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites 
basis as PG&E presented.

One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions 
of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement 
company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the 
success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the 
cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it 
will be a 2001 project.

6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.

Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic 
sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to 
the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the 
Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies 
to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will 
coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.

7. Other Issues or Concerns.

Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 
2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to 
Transwestern.  

PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 
mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S 
configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.  

8. Next Steps.

The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow 
inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection   
additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location 
of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as 
some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
other business.  "

Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would 
like more information 

(Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect 
confidentiality  - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential 
right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we 
don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties)



*EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against 
TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  Judge Edgar 
has been assigned the matter.

*The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA 
entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA).

*The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of 
TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to 
schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at 
the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at 
the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.  EPMI believes 
that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue.  

*A trial date in late June 2000 has been set.

*EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.

Hi Drew, hope the London digs are working out!  

I have a HR problem that we need to address immediately.  Today we let Britta 
Dinndahl go.  Her termination was a case study in how to screw up a 
termination.  She was let back onto the trading floor where she called and 
email people telling them about her termination.  I understand from Chris 
Mahoney that (neither Nigel nor) Yvonne Scoroer was ready to handle this 
today, even though they had been briefed many times about her upcoming 
termination.  It wasn't until early afternoon that I called Phillipe Bibi to 
tell him of her termination, when she was taken off system access.  

In addition Yvonne has had Erik Hansen's contract for over three weeks and 
has not produced paper for Erik to sign.  It was my hope to have him under 
contract before the bonus period.  Further Jen Fraser was trying to hire 
Andrew Hill as a new employee for the Fundamentals group in London, and on 
three occasions Yvonne told Jonny Palmer that she would get an offer letter 
to him ""today"".  It took three weeks.

Obviously these are extremely serious lapses, and I do not want Yvonne 
involved in any more Enron Global Markets.  Cindy and Shanna have done a 
heroic job for us in the U.S. and they have been extremely frustrated with 
their counterparts in London.

Thanks for addressing this issue.

0,"Vince and Grant,

First let me apologize for cancelling our meeting with you this Friday.  I 
hope we can reschedule next week as I'll arrive in Houston Monday mid-day.

I'd love to talk to you as I know the knowledge base in your group related to 
my new responsibilities is huge.  Will you be able to free up some time of 
some of your team members to help us?

As an example, I'd like to show you our position book (cash).  It's far from 
being perfect.  I'd like to know whether we should persevere and improve it 
or whether there are some models in ENA that we could copycat....

I look forward to seeing you next week,

I understand you may be able to shed some light on this.  I have received a 
complaint naming ECT as a defendant, filed by Jeff Brown, dba M&J Energy.  
The allegation is that his partner, Mr Buckey is diverting payments for gas 
purchased from  wells owned by Brown, Buckey and others.  The wells are 
described in the complaint as Rea #1 and #2 and Cullen #1 and $2 in 
Washington County, OH (Marietta).  ECT is named b/c ECT is buying the gas 
from the well and allegedly paying the wrong person for the gas (I can't see 
how that gives rise to any claim, but that's beside the point).

I can't find where EES is buying gas from this well, so that leaves you.  Is 
this ECT's gas?  MDS

:

        THE LATE-SEASON storm has killed at least four people from Colombia
to Dutch St. Maarten in the northeast Caribbean.
       On Tuesday, two fishermen drowned off Colombia=0F's Caribbean penins=
ula,
and rains destroyed half of a coastal village, leaving 540 people homeless.
       One man died in the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, after he fell of=
f
a ladder as he tried to board up windows. A man in St. Maarten died
Wednesday when the garden wall of his hillside home collapsed on him.
       The hurricane was unlikely to strike the mainland United States, sai=
d
meteorologist Stacy Stewart at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. He
cautioned, however, that Lenny still could bring heavy surf capable of
eroding beaches in Florida.
       =0F""The influence of this storm is going to be felt considerable
distances away,=0F"" he said.

       In St. Croix, an unidentified tourist who ventured out of a hotel to
see the rising surf was carried away by waves and had to cling to a rock fo=
r
more than an hour before local divers rescued him, said Gov. Charles
Turnbull of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
       Even before the hurricane arrived, storm surges that whipped up
12-foot waves stripped sand from Anguilla=0F's famous beaches. The beaches,
which attract tourists who provide the British island=0F's biggest source o=
f
revenue, already had been damaged by Hurricane Jose last month.
       Nearly 100 tourists had to be evacuated from a flooded hotel to
another hotel on higher ground in Anguilla.

A SEEMINGLY BACKWARD STORM
       Hurricane Lenny is a late-season storm with a seemingly backward
trajectory from west to east that surprised even seasoned forecasters.
       Feeding off the warm Caribbean waters, Lenny=0F's winds strengthened=
 to
150 mph Wednesday, just 5 mph short of being a Category 5 hurricane, the
strongest hurricane rating. Category 5 hurricanes can cause catastrophic
damage. By Thursday morning, the storm had weakened to 135 mph.
 Advertisement

           In San Juan, a few motorists speeded down highways usually choke=
d
with traffic and tooted their horns with delight that the storm, which
zigzagged on a course that confounded meteorologists, had missed them. But
nearly 100,000 people remained without water or electricity Wednesday night=
.
       The eye of the storm was expected to pass close to the Dutch
territories of St. Maarten, St. Eustatius, Saba and the British island of
Anguilla.
       Anguilla was drenched by 4 to 6 inches of rain in four hours
Wednesday afternoon, and its beaches were eroded by sea swells of up to 12
feet throughout the day.
       The storm=0F's first winds cut power and telephone service to many h=
omes
in St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The hurricane ripped up trees and
unleashed a steady rain that flooded large areas.
       The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent medical teams to
the Virgin Islands ahead of the storm. The agency=0F's director, James Lee
Witt, told reporters that damage assessors would fly in today.
       He said that while the hurricane damaged roofs, including that of th=
e
national armory, he did not expect widespread damage because FEMA had helpe=
d
the government institute new hurricane building codes after Hurricane
Marilyn devastated the islands in 1995.
       The territory has a $1 billion debt and still owes $8 million for
federal disaster loans from Hurricane Marilyn and Hurricane Hugo in 1989.

RUINOUS WAVES
       Waves smashed over the 8-foot sea wall at Frederiksted, the
second-largest town on the island, tearing away the wooden pier that was th=
e
fish market and a small part of the concrete pier where cruise ships dock.
       In Christiansted, St. Croix=0F's main town, the boardwalk was submer=
ged,
and winds tore part of the roof off the newly renovated King Christian
Hotel.
       The storm beached and sunk boats from Aruba, off Venezuela=0F's coas=
t in
South America, to Grenada and St. Kitts.
       On St. Kitts=0F' concrete pier, a half dozen people suffered fractur=
es
and other injuries when they were hit by waves. Storm surges in Grenada
swept away four houses, washed away asphalt roads, damaged runway lights at
the airport and flooded roads and the business district.
       Turnbull said Wednesday he was waiting for President Clinton to
declare St. Croix a disaster area, making it eligible for federal emergency
funds.

??????????Dear Lexi,  
?????????????????????????  my name is Andrew Haryono.? I am a UT student 
majoring in Professional  Program in Accounting.?I will be graduating this 
May 2001 with a MPA  degree.??I will also be sitting for the CPA exam this 
May.? Even  though I have an audit background,?my career interest is to do 
financial  and accounting analysis.? The analyst's job description at Enron 
matches  perfectly with my career interest.? I signed up for the internship  
opportunity through the careerportal system, because I could not find any 
full  time opportunity. As for now, I have not received answer from Enron.? I 
am  writing to ask further about the?career opportunity  with?Enron.
????????My questions  are:
1)? Is it possible to turn this analyst?internship  opportunity into 
full-time permanent opportunity?? 
2)??If that's not possible would you have opening  for me in the near future?
??? I am reattaching my resume.? Thank you  and I look forward?to hearing 
from you.

 "
0,"All--  Attached are my proposed edits to the ""framework"" in redline
form.  The vast majority are simply editorial changes designed to clarify
language without changing the intended meaning.  I would call your
attention to Sections 5.1 and 6.3 as the potentially more substantive
suggestions.  Since the change to 6.3 primarily adds detail to what is
clearly described as a small customer proposal and not an agreed-upon item,
I would hope that it won't cause any problems.  The proposed change to 5.1
is not intended to change the agreed-upon allocation of costs, but simply
to provide us with some badly needed ""cover.""  Edison undercollections
would be recovered out of ""headroom"" in existing rates (as was our shared
intention), and those rates could only change as provided in Section
4.  Thus, core customers would not escape any of the charges that they are
expected to bear, but we would provide less of a fat target for others to
shoot at.  I can be available to discuss this further if needed after the
Senate Judiciary committee hearing on the MOU scheduled for Thursday
morning (415-254-3597).
         The proposed letter is another matter altogether.  It is so
replete with language that we find troubling that an attempt to edit it
seemed fruitless.  Lenny will circulate a much shorter proposed alternative
that simply states what the attached document is, without attempting to
characterize people's reasons for supporting it.  If that approach is not
acceptable, then TURN will not sign on to the letter itself but rather will
provide a sentence or two of explanation over our separate
signature.  Hopefully one or the other of these approaches will
work.   Thank you all for your hard work on this effort, but I must confess
that I did not personally find it to be ""oddly satisfying.""     MIKE

0,"Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to 
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.

On 2/14, the Southern California Generator Coalition filed a petmod asking
that the Commission amend winter balancing rules to allow customers to
bring more gas into the system than the 10% imbalance rules permit and that
customers be allowed to use the previous month's accumulated positive
imbalance in lieu of flowing supplies.

The generator members of WPTF with facilities in southern California may be
interested in knowing that TURN's 3/15 comments recommend instead that the
Commission should rebundle the costs of storage for electric generators in
their transportation rates and requires SoCalGas to store gas on behalf of
those customers.

Let me know if you want to see the TURN comments.

Hi Sara and Ed!
ConEd wants to get going on an ISDA , in parallel to adjusting as necessary 
the long form for the upcoming transaction.  They believe that the ISDA will 
not be negotiated in time for when they want to execute, thus the parallel 
documents.  
Regarding the annex, the uncoming deals could potentially be swaps, collars, 
or participating swaps.
I think they are quite eager to hear our response.
Thanks,
Janelle

California Electric Utility Seeks to Recoup Costs from Customers 
Rick Burnham

09/27/2000 
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: The Press-Enterprise - Riverside, 
California 
Copyright (C) 2000 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM) 

Southern California Edison is asking state regulators for permission to 
charge customers for its soaring wholesale electricity costs -- a bill of 
nearly $2 billion and growing.

Under the 1996 legislation that deregulated the state's electricity industry, 
rates are frozen for the residential and small business customers of Southern 
California Edison and Pacific Gas&Electric until March 31, 2002 or until the 
utilities pay off their ""stranded assets,"" investments made in nuclear power 
plants and other obligations. 

That has left the utilities to pay the difference between the frozen rate and 
this summer's skyrocketing market rates.

As of Aug. 31, the difference -- known as an undercollection -- amounts to 
$1.97 billion for Edison, the company said Tuesday.

Not all details have been worked out, but Edison will file a request later 
this week with the state Public Utilities Commission asking for permission to 
recoup their unpaid electricity costs after the rate freeze ends, said Jim 
Scalacci, its chief financial officer.

Edison officials couldn't say how much the extra cost would add to the 
typical Edison residential customer's bill. But if the current $1.97 billion 
in undercollections were sought all at once as a rate increase, it would 
raise rates more than 20 percent, Scilacci said.

""Of course we would not propose that,"" Scilacci said. ""We would span it over 
a period of time.""

Instead, the utility will make another filing to regulators later this year 
for a ""rate stabilization plan"" that would include a rate increase and a 
mechanism to recover its undercollections over a period of time, Scalacci 
said.

The utility said it also would consider other options -- including a lawsuit 
-- to recoup the costs.

Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas&Electric, paid off its stranded assets 
more than a year ago, allowing it to pass through the full cost of 
electricity to its customers.

That resulted in SDGOaverage monthly residential bills skyrocketing from $40 
to $68 to $130 in less than three months this summer. After an outcry from 
SDGOcustomers, area politicians and consumer groups, the state legislature in 
August capped SDGOresidential rates to a maximum of $68 a month.

The deregulated electricity market does not affect customers of municipal 
utilities, such as those in the cities of Riverside, Colton, Banning and Los 
Angeles.

Under the deregulation law, the investor-owned utilities are able to recover 
undercollections from future positive revenues until they recover all 
stranded costs or the March 31, 2002 deadline.

Edison believes it already has amassed enough credits through the pending 
sale of power plants and the valuation of its hydroelectric properties to 
offset its $1.3 billion in stranded assets.

But so far, the PUC has denied requests from the utilities to regain their 
uncovered costs after the rate freeze ends. Regulators also have prohibited 
the utilities from continuing to collect the charge to offset stranded costs.

Pacific Gas&Electric appealed the PUC's denial, but the Califoria Court of 
Appeal denied its petition for review. The case is being appealed to the 
state Supreme Court.

Edison believes the PUC -- in refusing to allow the utilities to recoup 
undercollections past the 2002 deadline -- is misinterpreting California's 
electricity restructuring law.

""That law placed California electric utility companies at risk for recovery 
of their stranded costs, but did not place them at risk for recovery of the 
costs of procuring electricity for customers,"" Edison said in a filing with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

PUC President Loretta Lynch said she recognized that the utilities are 
hurting. But Lynch said the ultimate answer isn't to expect consumers to foot 
the entire bill.

The action by the utilities also appears to presume that California's 
electricity woes will continue, leaving them no way to recoup their costs in 
the future, Lynch said.

""The presumption that the market will stay out of whack the next two years is 
incorrect,"" Lynch said. ""I would hope the federal government will do 
something (about addressing the wholesale electricity market),"" she said.

Lynch said regulators will take a look at the total utility picture -- 
including the revenue utilities continue to make from generating power. 
""We'll be asking for the revenue side as well as the expense side,"" she said.

PUC commissioner Carl Wood, a former Riverside resident, said Tuesday that he 
thinks it's unreasonable to assume that just because Edison is making the 
request that it will be approved.

Wood said this summer's higher electricity rates have been caused at least in 
part by a dysfunctional market and what he calls ""unconscionable pricing.""

""Edison ought to focus on getting money back from the generators and 
suppliers ...,"" Wood said.

Meanwhile, consumer advocates in San Diego and San Francisco requested that 
candidates for state or federal office sign a Ratepayer Protection Pledge to 
protect consumers from ""unfair and unreasonable electric rates.""

The pledge, developed by TURN (The Utility Reform Network), The Foundation 
for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights and Consumers Union, was mailed to all 
candidates Tuesday.

""Utility-style deregulation has obviously failed, and lawmakers must act now 
to prevent the entire state from being thrown into a financial crisis,"" said 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of San Francisco-based TURN.

The consumer groups said that if politicians sign the pledge, they commit to 
oppose any legislation or efforts to force ratepayers to pay Edison, PGOor 
SDGOretrospectively for this summer's high wholesale energy costs. They also 
would agree to ""not allow for rate increases for PGOor Edison ratepayers 
during the rate freeze period and beyond until such time as rates are just 
and reasonable.""

TURN and FTCR said they will post a list of all candidates and their position 
on the pledge on their Web sites (www.turn.org) and 
(www.consumerwatchdog.org).

0,"Hi, Jeff.

I have been receiving several inquiries from UH volunteers on the Recruiting List wanting to confirm Nov 12 and 13.  I've been responding that we are waiting to review the resumes to determine the number of people needed to interview and greet.  

Most of the volunteers are Manager and above and need to mark their calendars now to avoid scheduling meetings on those days.  Greeters also need to obtain approval from their managers to take a day off with such short notice.  When do you think we'll know for sure the number of volunteers needed?  Also, do you have a need to review the resumes to select the on campus interview candidates?

Thanks in advance for your help.

processes that could be required.  In my experience, the single biggest issue 
the utilities have is the transfer of the rights of way -- there are 
thousands of these -- each like an individual contract.  If the state tried 
eminent domain, it seems like it could face a long-time in the courts to 
finish that process.

0,"I would like to move forward with what we are calling Phase III for EOL.  Most of the work is done but in this environment, I don't want to prepare to roll it out in January without your views.  However, if we are to roll it out in mid-January, we need to agree soon.
 
Richter has sent you the outline/presentation on e-mail and he and Savita and Jay can describe it all in greater detail if you like. 
 
Savita discussed the presentation and the plan with John Arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality. 
 
Basically it will include a new home page and a new garden page, but the key parts are the expanded quotes screen and the order manager which are a much better use of real estate than the static Reuters content down the side (which will be put in a MyContent button).  This isn't expensive, most of the work is done anyway, but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded.
 
I think it would be positive to do.  It looks better, the Reuters content can be found in a MyContent button and we can use the entire quotes screen to enhance order flow and improve the counterparty experience.  It also shows business as usual with EnronOnline.
 
Your thoughts?

DTI will not be charging for TTT service through June 01, they will probably not start to charge any time soon, however they still have the ability to charge.  My feeling is that they will find it difficult to charge after providing the service for free for some time.  If they do start to charge by nom is there a way we can provide that service?  I will think about that one.

legal budgeting.  The first is a list of open matter numbers which either a)
have been approved for some level of activity; or b) the attorneys assigned
to the case believe there may be some additional level of activity expected
or warranted in the future (in which case authorization will have to be
sought at the appropriate time).  The second list consists of matter numbers
we believe should be closed as we expect no more costs or activity in any of
these matters.  Please comment on either at your convenience.  I will

He called today and left the following message:

Phone is better than in person. Easier to cut off offensive inquiry. What do you think about making someone available in Houston?

In the meantime, I'll try to get more information about questions he would like to ask. I doubt that I will have any success in that effort.

approval. Please review.

Then:

Location: PGT Malin

Sort Code: 2850
Description: The transaction is for delivery at Pacific Gas Transmission 
Company - Malin.

Location: PG&E Pool
Abbreviation: PG&E Pool

Attached for your consideration is a draft motion to stike testimony related
to the embedded cost proposal in the SoCalGas/SDG&E BCAP.  I have drafted
this motion for EGA, but we would prefer to present it as part of a larger
group.  I have sent you this draft because you seem to represent parties who
might have similar concerns about the embedded cost proposal.
Would your clients be interested in co-sponsoring this motion?  If so,
please let me know as soon as possible.  Ideally, we would have a loose
group identified as the Moving Parties or something similar to sponsor the
motion.  I've dated the motion for Monday, because I think it would be most
effective if the motion is public when we discuss the schedule at Tuesday's
prehearing conference.
I would also appreciate any comments, edits, additions, or suggestions you
may have.  For example, we could use some more examples of other uses of
marginal costs in gas regulation.  Note that the wonders of Word's
footnoting function make this a little difficult to read on the screen.
If you're interested in joining in this motion, please let me know no later
than 10 a.m. Monday, December 3, and earlier is better.
Please keep this draft confidential for now.
Thanks,
Brian

0,"Though the electronic copy is not yet available, we have faxed out a hard copy of FERC's ""Order on Rehearing"" issued today in RM01-9, ""Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market.""  All requests for rehearing and clarification have been denied, as the requirement ""is in the public interest...[and further] is necessary for the Commission to advise Congress as to whether it should change the existing regulatory framework...""

Some major points are:

(1)    Arguments that FERC cannot require the info. from non-jurisdictional entities is disputed by citation to the NGA and FPA, allowing FERC to collect any information in order to advise Congress on a matter of urgent concern.  The Commission also cites the FPA's authorization to investigate electricity issues, including the cost of generation (of which natural gas is a key factor).

(2) In response to Enron's arguments, the order states the following:
	Enron argues that the data collection should be undertaken on an as-needed basis, not regularly; FERC simply denies this.
	Enron argues that the burden of reporting was underestimated; FERC says this may be true but is no reason to rescind the requirement.
	Enron argues that the reporting is not based on the business method utilized by the company and that it does not have the information on a daily pricing and volume basis (matched to physical volumes); FERC answers that data should be submitted ""in a manner consistent with the way the particular gas seller does business.""  Examples are given in the text of the FERC order.
	If Enron is contending it should only file aggregate information, FERC finds this option unacceptable.
	Only Enron asked for an extension for the filing deadline, from 30 days to 45 days after the close of each month; FERC denies this request as unnecessary.

(3) CPUC request for access to all information filed is denied.  Sensitive price data will be exempt from public disclosure (with no exceptions) so that all parties must comply.  The order also states, ""Moreover, the purpose in seeking the information is to enable the Commission to understand the operation of the market for gas sales into California, not to investigate the conduct of particular participants in that market."""

The Outlook

LOS ANGELES

Helmut Ackermann founded L.A. Dye & Print Works Inc. 18
years ago, when he took over a bankrupt dye house. Today,
thanks to California's worsening energy crisis, L.A. Dye &
Print is back on the brink of closure.

Mr. Ackermann depends on natural gas to operate the
massive boilers and heaters used to color and dry fabrics.
He expects his December gas bill to have jumped to
$600,000 from $132,000 last January. Hammered by the
soaring costs, he has already closed one plant and
dismissed 40 people. Now, he says the jobs of his
remaining 660 workers are in jeopardy. ""If it stays the
way it is, we won't be around very long,"" Mr. Ackermann
says.

Stories like this are causing economists to worry that
California's economic troubles -- the energy crisis,
combined with a high-tech shakeout and growing labor
unrest in the entertainment industry -- could put more
drag on a U.S. economy that is already downshifting.
Chart: California and the World Economy

The World's largest economies by gross national product,
in trillions of US dollars:
US                      $8.4
Japan                   $4.1
Germany                 $2.1
France                  $1.4
UK                      $1.3
California              $1.2
Italy                   $1.1
China                   $1.0
Source: World Bank

The energy mess is ""one more negative added to the mix,""
says Tom Lieser, a senior economist at the University of
California at Los Angeles's Anderson Business Forecast. He
expects California to navigate its way through the
immediate crisis but worries about its longer-term impact.
Questions about the reliability and cost of the state's
power supply, for example, could threaten continued growth
of vital industries such as technology.

Some Wall Street economists worry that California's
problems could spill over and hurt the broader U.S.
economy. In a report titled ""California Unplugged -- A
Drag on Global Growth?"" Morgan Stanley Dean Witter warns
that California's energy crisis threatens to push up
production costs and make U.S. exports from the state,
which totaled $102.9 billion in 1999, less competitive on
world markets.

""Negatives tend to snowball, so what is happening in
California has the potential to exacerbate the weakness we
already are seeing in the U.S. economy,"" says Joseph
Quinlan, a Morgan Stanley economist.

Other states facing economic and financial trouble
wouldn't warrant such attention. But California not only
is the nation's largest state in terms of both population
and economic heft, but the Golden State also seemed to
epitomize the New Economy. Job growth in the state has
been double that in the nation as a whole; of the 2.1
million jobs created in the U.S. during the first 11
months of last year, one of every five new hires was in
California. The state produced more than $1.2 trillion in
output in 1999, making it the sixth-largest economy in the
world, slightly smaller than the economy of the United
Kingdom and a little bigger than that of Italy. The
state's economic output contributed about 12% of total
U.S. gross domestic product. New York, in second place,
had an 8.1% share of GDP.

But soaring energy costs are beginning to take a toll on
the Golden State, and low-end manufacturers are among the
first to see the change. ""It is forcing many of us to face
a shutdown,"" says Scott Edwards, president of the
Association of Textile Dyers, Printers and Finishers of
Southern California. His industry runs on gross profit
margins of 10% to 15%, hardly enough to handle the
fivefold increase in natural-gas costs that many operators
have witnessed.

Soaring energy prices also are hurting California's
agricultural industry. ""We can't pass along the costs of
production"" as some other industries do, says Heather
Flower, a spokeswoman for the Western Growers Association,
a group of 3,500 growers in California and Arizona. Some
are cutting back on plantings of broccoli, lettuce and
strawberries, among other crops, because of uncertainty
about costs.

Electricity prices already are on the march. The state's
largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co., received temporary rate increases
last week ranging from 9% for residential customers to 15%
for large companies. Some economists say the rises, if
they become permanent, could wipe out a large chunk of
per-capita-income gains and result in less consumer
spending.

On top of the energy problems, Hollywood is bracing for a
strike by the Writers Guild of America and the unions
representing film and television actors, whose contracts
are set to expire this year. The studios spent the end of
2000 jamming in production to cushion the impact of a
potential strike. The sector employs nearly 300,000 people
in the state.

While there seems little doubt that the troubles brewing
in California will prove painful, there are reasons to
believe the state can still avert an outright economic
contraction. Its economy is more diversified and resilient
than a decade ago, when national-defense cutbacks and an
overbuilt property market crippled the local economy. Back
then, jobs in the aerospace sector shrank by 70%, and
office-vacancy rates in major markets soared.

Also, despite all the attention being given to the state's
energy crisis, the fact is ""we're not a very
energy-intensive economy,"" says Ted Gibson, chief state
economist with California's department of finance. He
notes that the state ranks 48th among the 50 states in
per-capita energy consumption. And he adds that the $11
billion in deficit spending racked up by the two big
utilities amounts to less than 1% of state output. ""It's
not the kind of cost that will bring the state to its
knees,"" he says.

		 Subject: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?

Mark, thanks for the voice mail.  In terms of a risk memo, I agree that one 
should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as 
normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master 
Agreement and without an outlay of capital, but hopefully the following 
(together with my memo from last night - copy attached) suffices to the 
extent a risk memo is required.

In terms of unusual risks:

1.  We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master.  
However, the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially 
Government of Alberta credit risk.  Derek Davies is I believe dealing with 
Credit to resolve credit issues.  In fact, I believe the Balancing Pool is 
taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which 
does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds.

2.  The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental 
guarantee of Enron Corp. and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for 
collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron 
Corp.'s creditworthiness.

3.  It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into 
back-to-back physical hedges for 70% of the volume we acquire, and we are 
currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding 
and being successful in the auction.  Penalties can be imposed if 70% of the 
volume purchased is not properly hedged.

4.  As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta, we always run the risk 
(as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired 
in the first auction) that they can change the auction rules, the market 
rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us.  In terms of the 
auction rules, as with the first auction, they could be better drafted, but 
our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post 
a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back, and to ensure that 
the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete 
control of whether or not we can comply with the rules.

Peter.

Subject: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?

Mark, as I have mentioned to you the Plan B Alberta Power Auction is 
scheduled for Nov 29/00, under which Enron Canada can purchase for one-year 
terms, in each of three successive years, up to approximately 300MW/year #1;  
130MW/year #2; and 65MW/year #3, of the unsold PPA capacity that reverted 
back to the Balancing Pool of Alberta following the first auction last 
August.  The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US 
Thanksgiving is Thursday/Friday.  I wanted you to be aware of this, and 
determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained.

Firstly, Derek Davies/John Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent 
authorized by Lavo.

Secondly, bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction, the forms 
of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are 
successful, and requires a bid deposit (approximately C$6.5MM), but does not 
obligate us to bid and, provided we comply with the auction rules, the Bid 
Deposit will be returned after the auction.

Thirdly, unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms 
of volume and term.  In terms of documentation, if we are the successful 
bidder, we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical 
Master, which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which, 
although not entirely to our liking, is generally satisfactory.

Fourthly, the position will, I understand, be managed in the power trading 
book within approved position limits.  Note:  The nominal amounts owing (i.e. 
no up front payment is required) on an unhedged basis for the entire 300MWs 
in year #1 would be something like C$260MM, assuming a C$100/MW purchase 
price.  Year #2 would be C$114MM and year #3 would be C$57MM.

Given the nature of the transaction, the short time that we have with US 
Thanksgiving intervening, and numerous other demands, I do not believe that a 
DASH, Risk Memo and/or Board Approval is necessary, but please let me know.

I will leave you a brief voice mail to follow-up.

Peter.

                A MESSAGE FROM DON EVANS
               CHAIRMAN, BUSH-CHENEY 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Sunday, November 11, 2000



  Dear Friend,


  This is an urgent message to supporters of Governor George
  W. Bush and Secretary Dick Cheney regarding the situation
  in Florida.

  It is now clear we must raise money to fund the recount
  effort in Florida.  Governor Bush won the vote on Election
  Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, the other
  side is seeking yet a third count by hand.  There is a
  reason why ballots are counted by computer and not by hand.

  The expense of the recount effort must be funded
  immediately.  Please send a check in any amount that you
  can up to $5,000 today. These contributions, in keeping
  with Governor Bush's ""full disclosure"" policy on financial
  contributions, will be posted on the Bush-Cheney website.
  Any funds not spent will be returned on a pro rata basis.

  To contribute, please click here:
  http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf to
  download the Bush-Cheney recount fund reply form. Please
  fill out the form and mail in with your donation.

  We are setting up a site for secure online credit card
  contributions.  As soon as the Web site is available,
  we'll send out an e-mail with the link for online
  contributions.

  Remember:
  1. Checks must be personal, not corporate.
  2. Checks should be payable to Bush-Cheney Recount Fund.
  3. Download and fill out this form:
     http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf
  4. Mail or overnight check to:
        Donald L. Evans
        301 Congress Avenue
        2nd Floor/Bush-Cheney Recount Fund
        Austin, Texas 78701
  5. These funds do not count against your annual personal
     federal giving limit of $25,000.

  Thank you for your friendship and support.  If you have
  friends that can help, please forward this message to them
  immediately.   We thank you for all that you did to help
  elect Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.  We also thank
  you in advance for your willingness to help us during this
  important time in the life of our country.


  Sincerely,

  Don Evans

inundated with information over the next day or so.  Let me know if the 
message below does not come through in color since it will be difficult to 
decipher.

Louise is quite anxious to finalize the ETA, PA and Read-only PA and I 
explained that we were still waiting for the proposed changes from London.  
Knowing Louise I have a feeling we may see that stuff soon.

Since we seem to be a bit behind schedule, Louise agreed that an all-hands 
legal meeting next week might be premature and she is contacting the London 
team to discuss scheduling.  I'll let you know as soon as I have anything 
more to report on the calendar.

Subject: Registration Process Questions  

Let's be clear about all of the confusion which took place last week on how 
to register,  this is what we are doing.  Any comments or problems please 
reply.  I have tried to address everyone's points (see end of email).  

1.  Current Customers

We are going to pre-register a large number of customers prior to the 
launch.   These customers will not  receive any documentation from us apart 
from the one page application form (Password Application) and a nice glossy 
marketing brochure.

They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation.  
All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these 
people.

Procedure
1.  A list of customers to be pre-registered is compiled.
2.  Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax, Credit, Legal etc.
3. The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form (postal) and 
a marketing brochure (this will be very glossy with only high level details 
nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process 
(to include whether to send to UK os  US office).  The PA will be specific to 
each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to 
each counterparty.
4. The customer signs the document (Password Application) and returns to 
Enron. 
5. Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login.
6.  The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as 
loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the 
country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the 
customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice 
of either ""I accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This 
ETA must be printable.
7.   The customer then enters the site and transacts.  If the customer is 
transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not 
need to be accepted, if the customer is dealing without a master then any 
person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords 
can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under 
this SA password).  The system will need to be loaded with the information as 
to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodity/product type.

Elena's questions
Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the 
""House""?  No only in the garden.  PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be 
available and printable in the garden (drop down box would be my suggestion).

2.  New Customers

There are two alternative routes possible.

Procedure 1: Off Line Registration

Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade 
online, i.e. get the ID and Password
Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for 
appropriate jurisdiction.
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the 
system administrator login and password.
The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded 
for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of 
origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will 
scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either ""I 
accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be 
printable.
The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting 
GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or 
any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be 
accepted once by any one person under this SA password).  


Procedure Two:  Partial OnLine Registration
Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in 
the Garden
Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out 
appropriate Registration Form and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and 
mail it to Enron
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the 
system administrator login and password.
The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded 
for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of 
origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will 
scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either ""I 
accept"" or ""I do not accept"" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be 
printable.
The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting 
GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or 
any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be 
accepted once by any one person under this SA password).  

The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but 
clearly Janine may want to add more on her side.

Elena's questions
Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2? Both
 2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential customers that there request for access may not be granted.  YES - 
In the  garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and 
that it is solely on our discretion (this is not just for Read Only its for 
all applications)
 3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC 
prefers them to be available...YES

3.  Read Only Customers

If a customer / counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore 
has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading 
counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are 
missing.  So we will be sending them a password and login for read only 
access.  We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but 
that will be up to the traders - any counterparties wanting access like this 
would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we 
would authorise readonly access.  We will no be advertising read only access 
as available.

They will be able to enter the site for a period for time (Enron needs to be 
capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a 
customer/counterparty is given read-only access for) unable to transact but 
view only.  

Procedure
1.  Either, Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered 
against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has 
not registered.  The trading desk with primary trading contact with such 
counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only 
access for a period of time.
or,   a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only 
access for one of his customers.
2.  The Product Control Group will issue a password/login which will be time 
dated (only valid for a certain period).
3. The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA  - 
these are to be country specific.  
4. The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the 
site where he has been given READ ONLY access.  
5.   Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of 
creating any further passwords (not like a system administrator password).
6. When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they 
should register to continue seeing prices.

Elena's issues
1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where? YES - should be printable 
when it appears on screen at login (no need for it to be in the garden)
2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in 
session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to 
put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all 
jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th. Needs to be flexible although 
one password has no capability of creating further passwords, but the period 
of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader.  Some customers 
may be allowed in for one day others for one month.
3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be 
granted. We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not 
be mentioned in the garden.  The only phrase in the garden refers to 
customers who apply for a password may not get access (see above).
4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to 
Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line, 
but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner 
way...No this will be signed/clicked online just like the ETAs.

Mark's comments
System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned. 
If they are in reality that is none of our concern.  Agreed - we need to 
change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator
ETA acceptance process - we have legal confirmation of your comment? I would 
expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it 
(which I think is where Bob is coming from). Only one person per System 
Administration Password / Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA.

Guest only users
This concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday - and I have some 
process queries on it. See above.
How do we separate/ identify the applications? See above.
What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for 
full rights?  They need to receive a notice when their password expires which 
prompts them to follow the application process.

2 other queries  -
Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade 
electronically? Need a Read Only ETA - see document for further understanding
Limitations to be imposed - where is this being coded and who by? There will 
be a timetable impact. This is not new and therefore isn't

Bob's comments

1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.
The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his 
users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders?  
Probably will be a trader - change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR 
PASSWORD/ MASTER TRADING PASSWORD

3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get 
Trading Access
Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer 
base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control / 
System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we 
cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed 
off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort, 
single point of reference).
The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there 
will be the registration form, I think we do both alternatives.

Tim's comments

 The process you have described is as I understood things, except
that for Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users - Regulators,
Lawyers, Brokers, Potential Traders etc).  As we discussed on Wednesday and
as Andrew mentioned yesterday, I understood the process to be as follows:

 The Guest will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online,
that will be automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator.
Customers will provide info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address,
country of incorporation  etc.   If Enron approves the customer as a Guest
user, the System Administrator will  e-mail/fax to the Guest the Read Only
ETA.  The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it to
Enron (by fax or post).  Enron will then issue a Guest ID and Password.  The
Read Only ETA will be available on the website as a reminder to the Guest.
This will not be in hard copy it will be online, see above we are not going 
to advertise this read only capability.

OK?

worry about giving me your  credit card number, etc.? It will be easier for 
me to pay for it from here  and then you can just reimburse us.? In fact, you 
can give a check to Papi  and he can deposit it for us there.
??? I'm taking the Girl Scouts on  an all day outing today to an indian 
village so I won't talk with the travel  agent today.? However,? I'll call

The schedule is probably aggressive, depending on when we get a power marketing license.  The plan is short on back end details until the eventual buyer is known, and until we know VAR, capital, etc.

for energy purchases on their behalf, either by DWR or SDG&E, not while

The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

0,"We should protest this issue and argue that nothing should change but that 
the Px credit should be based on DJ-NP15 and DJ-SP15 rather than the defunct 
Px because AB1890 requires it to be based on market (not costs).  Changing to 
procured energy is inconsistent with the law AB1890 which requires DA 
customers to be indifferent to buying from DA suppliers.  
And since DA suppliers face costs close to DJ-NP15/SP15, that is the only 
appropriate available method.  

Further, the issue of how to calculate Px is interrelated to whether DA 
customers should be charged the generation surcharges ($10 +$30).  DA 
customers should be given market based Px credits (based on DJNP15/SP15) 
because its the law.  There are 2 possible interpretations resulting from the 
combination of AB1890 and the new law.  
The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and not pay any 
surcharge.
The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and pay the $30 + $10 
surcharges
Interpretation 1 results in DA customers getting lower rates than all other 
customers.  It seems unlikely that the legislation would have this intent.
Interpretation 2 results in DA customers getting the same rate as all other 
customers until the end of AB1890.  This seems like the likely interpretation 
since otherwise the new legislation would have repealled AB1890.  Thus given 
that the DA customers are being held indifferent to frozen rates plus $40, 
they should get a Px market based credit plus pay the surcharge until the 
rate freeze ends.

Once the Px credit ends (Mar 2002), the surcharge should end because the law 
(AB1890) no longer requires them to be held at frozen rates and because:
Any customer that is being served by a supplier other than DWR and the 
utility is not causing any costs for DWR or the utility therefore they should 
not be charged for them.

In the event that Px credit is not set based on market value (if the courts 
interpret the law differently than Enron) then there should be no generation 
surcharge for DA customers.

This is the same argument we should make in our brief on rate setting

Subject: SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit -- Protest


As you are aware, SCE made an advice filing on April 5th to eradicate the PX
Rate Schedule and Replace it with Schedule PE --Procured Energy.  As part of
the filing, SCE proposes to set ""on an interim basis"" the cost of energy
procurement, for bundled service customers for billing purposes and in the
calculation of the energy credit for direct access customers equal to the
Generation rate component of the Customer's otherwise applicable tariff.

Two primary issues arise from SCE's statement. First what does ""interim
basis"" mean -- how long will this be in effect.  In starts on January 19th,
but it is unclear as to when it would end. Second, and most important. is
what is meant by the Generation rate component.  While there is not much
explanation in the April 5 advice letter, in a subsequent advice letter
filed on April 11 (1533-E), SCE set forth ""Rate Schedule Specific Generation
Related Rates"" which range between five and nine cents.

I have forwarded both the referenced advice letters to you earlier.  We need
to protest the change in the PX credit by Wednesday, April 25th.  All
thoughts on the matter are welcome.

John, we are confirmed with both the Premier's office and Lay for the 19th of June. I assume that you will be attending also. What are your thoughts on who should attend the Harris meeting and what other meetings should we set up to maximize the use of yours/Lay's time.

Brian Purchase is a key decision maker in Wilson's office. My thought was that you could meet with Wilson and Purchase. Aleck believes that it would be beneficial for Lay to meet with them also.

It is really Purchase I want Lay to meet, and it would be hard for Lay to meet Purchase without including Wilson (assuming of course he is available).  They will be among the key decision makers going forward.   If you have any other suggestions about how to make the best use of Lay's time here, please let me know.

		 Subject: Commodity Exchange Act, as revised by CFMA

Enclosed is a version of the Commodity Exchange Act, redlined to show how it 
has been revised by the CFMA.  This document was e-mailed to me earlier today 
by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.



Chris, the language in the ""Definitions"" sections (Section 1a) is what 
concerns us most.

A new definition has been added -- ""EXEMPT COMMODITY"" which is (14) of Sec. 
1a (not to be confused w/ ""EXCLUDED COMMODITY,"" which is (13) of Sec 1a.).  
The new ""scheme"" is as follows -- an ""excluded"" commodity (essentially, 
financials and weather) is the most deregulated, an ""exempt"" commodity is 
almost but not quite as deregulated, and agricultural commodities are still 
subject to full jurisdiction of the CFTC and the Commodity Exchange Act.

As you can see, the definition of ""Exempt Commodity"" is simply stated as 
everything other than an excluded commodity or agricultural commodity.  The 
ambiguity is that ""agricultural commodity"" is not defined, so the question is 
-- is the reference to ""agricultural commodity"" here meant to encompass 
coffee, sugar and cocoa as well as grains and meats? 

FYI, the list of ""enumerated"" agricultural commodities is in (4) of Sec 1a, 
in the old definition of ""COMMODITY,"" which remains in the Act.  Usually, 
when regulators wish to reference the restricted list of grains and meats, it 
is this section they refer to.  In fact, Congress referred expressly to this 
list in other places in the CFMA.  For example, see the new Section 4p(c)(1) 
(which is on page 59 of the attached document).

Please feel free to call me w/ any comments or questions.  Thanks -- Bob

Subject: Suemar Berryman; Gulf Plains Plant for Current Month

Daren,

As you know, we have experienced some fluctuations at the Berryman well for 
OCT, which in turn affects our volumes at the Gulf Plains Plant.  From a 
physical standpoint, I think that we are fairly well balanced.  My concern is 
that we are ""overproduced"" on paper by 76,162 Dth/Mo.   I think that we need 
to bring the nominations up to balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and, a 
corresponding volume at Meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on Strangers to 
keep the physical side in line.  If my understanding is correct (and if not, 
please correct me) this should have a positive impact on our current month 
UA4.

Thank you,

Mary

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

		 Subject: Statement on Energy Crisis


I have prepared a statement on the California energy crisis in response to
a solicitation from the Wall Street Journal, and attach a preliminary first
draft in pdf and Wordperfect formats.  This may or may not appear in some
edited form as an op-ed piece in the WSJ.  Although this statement is in
my own words, I believe it is consistent with the Manifesto.  I would
appreciate feedback from my fellow economists if I have made statements that
contradict the Manifesto, or most critically have made arguments that they
feel are not sound economics.  I will try to incorporate suggestions in the
next draft.  Thanks for your reaction.

I am also sending copies of this draft to a couple of people in the media
other than the WSJ, and they are welcome to use the content but not the text
if they want a summary of my take on the crisis.

   As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and then
about CDS,
the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest
privately owned
manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing 
its
finances,
so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annual
revenue and
to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the
business of
manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R))
food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other
products.

Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that
emphasizes the
long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win
solutions with
its suppliers, customers and partners.

As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its
expenses
goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of
researching
those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand
(people
eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).

CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very
successful,
with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in
these arenas.
CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports 
the
purchasing
function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a
multidiscipline and
multinational team with a lot to offer.

Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based
on
manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in 
this
area.
Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to
talk to.

In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to
anything
at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to
pursue the opportunity
we discussed in the future.

I am looking forward to our video conference call.

Kind regards,

Avi

0,"As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to Enron.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to Enron.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at Enron.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with Enron a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving 
Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a 
good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be 
reachable through the general number for Koch.

Admin assistants

Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative 
assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for 
PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in 
Enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not 
worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked 
to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC 
number).

Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave 
PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on 
how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line)."

0,"Yes, the correct name does include ""Inc."" at the end. And yes, Steve Hall 
said the master agreement works for this trade. He and Bob Ellery at Sierra 
talked over the agreement and decided to use the name that Sierra Pacific 
Holding Co. is doing business under. I've changed the deal (573679) in 
EnPower. Please let me know if you turn up any more questions.

Regarding the deal Chris Foster did on 4/6 with Sierra Pacific Holding Co. -

Bob Ellery, Sierra's Director of Energy Resources, and Steve Hall, one of 
Portland's most expeditious lawyers, have decided to execute the deal under 
the designation Sierra Pacific Industries, which is also named in the master 
agreement. We still, however, need this name added to the counterparty list 
in EnPower.

Thank you all for your help on this, and I appreciate your future assistance

from a friend in Austin....
The uncut version.

i went to both the am and the pm practices yesterday, and let me
re-re-re-iterate that we have a great group of receivers and that the stud
dog bad ass mofo of the group is roy williams.  he is physically way beyond
not only vasher and the walkon CBs trying to cover him, but the rest of the
college ranks.  ahmad brooks was standing by him in street clothes, and
there ain't a chance he could stop roy.  roy flies past people and gets way
the fuck up there and takes the ball out of the clouds.  he's a fucking
randy moss, but you know what?  he's bigger than randy moss and as fast as
randy moss and probably has as good a vertical as randy moss:

Moss
height: 6'4""
weight:  198 lbs.
40 speed: 4.3
vertical: ?

Roy
height: 6'5""
weight: 210 lbs.
40 speed: 4.3
100 speed: 10.38
high jump: 6'10""
long jump: 24'

we may just have the next superhuman WR on our team.  pray for no injuries.
i'm going to the pm practice today, too.  got a hard-on just thinking about
roy.  probably will see a few NFL GMs there.

and the other WRs are spectacular, too.  sloan is 6'2"" and does well at
establishing and holding position vs. the cover man.  BJ is 6'1"" and has
really soft hands.  i watched BJ, vasher and jeffrey field 12-15 punts each
at 60 yds with a cross wind in the pm session.  vasher and jeffrey had
technical problems and bobbled or dropped almost half.  BJ never bobbled or
dropped one.  as soon as it's close, he just sucks it in and takes off.  and
that's how he catches balls on the crossing routes.  vacuum hands.

it's going to be unfuckingreal a year or two down the road when these guys
have experience and simms gets to throw to them on the field three at a
time.  you can't doubleteam them all.

put simply, i think the days of our using white 5'7"" WRs are over.

It has been a valiant effort but as soon as we free up space on the Notes 
server it fills back in. 
So as a result we will be shutting down the notes server tonight from 8:00 PM 
until 12:00 AM to rebuild the data drives. This will provide more space to 
work with and allow for room to grow.
We will also be turning on a purge agent in 2 weeks that will eliminate mail

Please shut down Lotus Notes before you leave to night to help ensure we do

I have attached an Action Plan that sets forth the steps that various groups 
within Enron needs to take to have an impact on the current gross receipts 
tax regime currently in place in Argentina.  This plan addresses more 
specifically some of the issues in the memo that Sara and I sent out a few 
weeks ago.

We would like to set up a meeting to discuss the plan with you and assign 
responsibility for various parts of the proposal.  Brent will be back in 
Argentina later this week.  Brent, Sara and I usually talk on Friday morning 
regarding Argentine issues.    If you are available at 11:00 Argentina time, 
we will discuss the Action Plan with you at that time.  If that is not a 
convenient time, please advise and we will set up another time for the 
meeting that fits into your schedule.

		 Subject: RBOC Sec. 271 Legislative Update

We have some additional information on this as well that we just got wind of 
this afternoon.  The Interlata relief bill that will be introduced on Monday 
or Tuesday by Congressmen Tauzin and Dingell will be nearly identical to last 
year's bill, H.R. 2420.  Tauzin will hold a full committee hearing on the 
bill next Wednesday with invited witnesses to include Verizon, Covad, Highway 
One (a DSL carrier in NY) and McLeod.  We aren't aware of any administration 
types being invited, i.e. Powell or someone from NTIA.  A subcommittee markup 
will likely be scheduled for the following week, with the full committee 
mark-up to occur sometime before Memorial Day, depending on what is happening 
in the Committee with regards to the California situation.

On the Senate side, we are hearing that Senator Sam Brownback will 
reintroduce his RBOC legislation from last year which is more of a RBOC 
friendly bill than Tauzin's in that RBOCs would no longer be subject to 
Federal requirements concerning facilities and equipment carriage of advanced 
communications services.  We understand that Brownback intends to introduce 
his legislation sometime before Memorial Day but that he is actively seeking 
a Democratic co-sponsor, something that he was not able to do last Congress 
either.  Opponents of the bill are working the Senate side to ensure he does 
not find an ally.  We understand that Tauzin has kept in close contact with 
his fellow Louisianan Senator John Breaux on the goings-on in the House and 
that Breaux may be willing to help move things along in the Senate, however 
as Scott stated previously, Senator McCain, as we know, is likely not to take 
an active position on the legislation.  Senators Hollings (Ranking Member of 
the Commerce Committee), Senator Stevens and Senator Lott are all said to be 
against moving forward with any form of 271 relief.  Despite all of the 
Senate activity, the bottom line is that Scott's assessment is accurate - we 
don't see anything moving out of the Senate this year.

		 Subject: RBOC Sec. 271 Legislative Update

Federal Sec. 271 Relief Legislation:  Rep. Billy Tauzin, Chairman of the 
House Commerce Committee, is expected to introduce legislation on 4/23 to 
enable ILECs to provide interLATA data services without opening their local 
networks to competitors.  The bill would allow the Bells to transmit data 
across local market boundaries and also allow the RBOCs to deploy 
high-capacity facilities without having to lease or resell them as UNEs. Rep. 
John Dingell, the Commerce Committee ranking member will be a co-sponser.

This bill last Congress had over 200 co-sponsors and made it to committee 
mark-up, but was stifled by then-Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley and supporters 
of AT&T.  This year, Tauzin is expected to push it through his committee 
vigorously and it may come to the House floor for a vote.  However, the 
Senate seems unlikely to take this up in a serious way this year due to Sen. 
McCain's reluctance to follow Rep. Tauzin's agenda and Sen. Hollings' solid 
support of AT&T.  We expect this legislation to create a lot of noise this 
year, but not move through the Senate until next year if at all.

0,"Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple 
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, 
maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan 
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to 
keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the 
left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  That 
might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch 
would 
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and 
have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my 
alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed 
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan 
allowed.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."
0,"This letter goes a good bit further than we have with any of the North 
American counterparties negotiating the ETA in that it identifies only those 
portions of the ETA that control over the masters rather than identifying 
those provisions which are subject to the masters.  In my view there are 
really only very few places where we do not want the ETA to govern.  Most of 
the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent 
there either should be no conflict with the master or if, by some tortured 
interpretation there is a conflict, the ETA should control.  In one case I 
had to go through the entire ETA with the counterparty's lawyer, paragraph by 
paragraph, to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow 
the master to control.  The only sections we had to amend were the first 
sentence of section 3(e) (regarding confirmations - this may be different in 
the UK version), the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of 
section 6(e).  And of course nearly every counterparty making comments has 
insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or 
another.

Maybe if PowerGen is intransigent, they would be willing to add a sentence to 
the letter indicating that the ETA will control regarding the acess to and 
use of the website.  In an attempt to differentiate between our contractual 
trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website, 
perhaps Paragraph 3(a) can read something like ""Except as set forth under 
paragraph 3.(b) and (c) below, in the event of any conflict between the ETA 
and the master agreement, with respect to the terms of any Transactionthe 
master agreement shall prevail.

If we have to use this letter, my only other suggestion to the language would 
be to refer in paragraph numbered 1 to ""The agreements listed beloweach
comprises a"" or better yet ""Each agreement listed below is a"" rather than 
""The agreements listed below comprise the"".

Dave,

I'm trying to reach agreement with PowerGen re: EOL trades - they are still 
very concerned with the overriding effect of the ETA, and will not accept our 
position.

However, I have managed to get somewhere..........and I attach a draft I 
propose to send to their lawyer.  This is I believe as far as we can get with 
PowerGen (I did speak to him and I don't think he will go any further than as 
set forth in the draft).  The key point for me was to get PowerGen to agree 
(which I think they will) that the short + long descriptions [key elements of 
any trade] prevail over the master.

Thoughts, comments please....

My view - if PowerGen agrees the draft, that should give us sufficient 
comfort...

Thanks

This is a broad attempt to put some structure around the multitude of issues

conceive these ventures (in addition to reducing redundancy).

In regards to the legal analysis that must be conducted, I have attached the

internal sponsors and managers understand the issues at hand prior to and 
during the formation of these businesses, and 
be able to talk to legal experts such as yourselves about the business' role

Potentially, triggers or thresholds for ""classification"" may be relevant, but 
I defer to your judgement those issues that may be of

Subject: Letter of Intent


	


Gentlemen,

I have received a fax confirmation of Mr. Bruciak's execution of the 
Confidentiality Agreement this afternoon.  Thank you.

Attached is a draft Letter of Intent (""LOI"") pertaining to our discussions 
about the feasibility and development of an approximate 500 MW power station 
sited at or near the Port of Brownsville.  The LOI is structured similarly to 
the existing Participation Agreement, wherein BPUB and ENA exclusively 
collaborate to investigate the feasibility of the power station and secure a 
suitable site, if justified.  It is proposed that ENA cover the costs of the 
development effort, including permitting and site acquisition, with such 
costs being eventually treated as either Project construction costs or 
operating costs, depending upon the nature of the expense.  I have also 
proposed that ENA pay BPUP a $10,000 Consulting Fee to cover any outside 
expenses associated with the drafting and execution of this agreement and the 
site option agreement(s).  The proposed term of the LOI expires 31 December 
2001, unless either of us determines earlier that the joint effort will not 
be successful.  During the term of the LOI, it is proposed that BPUB and ENA 
will determine and agree upon an appropriate Project equity participation and 
finance structure.

Something we may want to consider is the transfer of BPUB's equity in the 
Oklaunion plant in exchange for equity in the new Cameron County plant.  This 
would be especially appealing if BPUB's interest in Oklaunion also included 
switching rights through the nearby DC Tie and if there are additional 
Oklaunion interests available with DC Tie switching rights.  

Please let know a convenient time when we talk through the proposed LOI and 
address any of your questions.

To give you an indication of the current value of your generation,  San Juan 
offers are running about NYMEX less $.20/MMBtu for most forward months.  That 
puts the fixed price about $5.50 - $5.75.  Peak Palo Verde Bids are

Q3 - $520
Q4 - $190
Q1 2001 - $125

It looks like you are in the money at least through the end of the year.

We have been looking at the transmission issue.  What substation would you be 
able to deliver to?  We can determine if transmission is available.  

Irrespective of availability, I still believe Salt River or APS will be the 
best physical bid for your energy as they can keep it in their system and 
avoid transmission.  

I would like to push forward to get ISDA swap contracts in place with BHP.  I 
remember losing a deal with Francis Mcalister a few years ago despite being a 
better offer because contracts were not in place.  Enron North America does 
not have an ISDA with BHP.  We could also push to get a physical electricity 
contract in place.  I think we have a physical gas contract.

Would you like to push ahead to get contracts in place?  Let me know.  It is 
not too early to start the process as it typically takes a month or so to 
make it happen.  What would be the name of the counterparty?  You are the US 
subsidiary of BHP correct?

Subject: Top 10 List for Canada Government Affairs and Recommendations for GA 
Group

 TOP 10 PRIORITIES                                    1.  Alberta Power 
Purchase Agreements -  If Enron Canada is successful in the PPA auction, 
Enron Canada will have a very long position in the Alberta wholesale market; 
continued risk mitigation efforts, advocacy of  good transmission and 
distribution tariffs,  and development of rules for Plan ""B"" ( for those 
units that received no bids) will be 
critical.                                   2.  Continued support for  
ongoing commercial transactions other than the PPAs and help in 
identification of where commercial opportunities are. (An example of the 
later, work  with commercial people to analyze how recent initiative re 
transmission tariff and wholesale market design in Ontario enhance 
opportunities for ""Power by the Hour"" and other distributed generation 
projects.)                              3. Ontario Electricity Market Opening 
- work to avoid further delay in market opening and advise on the development 
of procedures and practices for the new market. (As an example of the later, 
working with traders in Toronto and Houston to understand mechanisms for 
interregional trade and transmission rights, and the commercial  
opportunities that exist.)                                  4. Enhancement of 
wholesale market design in Alberta and Ontario.                              
5. Assist Enron Canada and EES Canada  in better understanding rules 
applicable   to wholesale and retail transactions in Ontario and 
Alberta.                     6. Alberta Natrural Gas 
Unbundling.                                  7. Renewed focus on potential 
for restructuring of power markets in British Columbia in the event that the 
New Democrats (socialists) are defeated and replaced  by a Liberal  
(pro-business) government in the province.                                
RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MORE 
EFFECTIVE                                              1. Encourage 
government affairs staff based outside of Houston to make periodic visits to 
Houston to meet with Houston based group and to meet with commercial groups 
in Houston. (In our case this would include Calgary).                         
      2. Replace or supplement the large group meetings with smaller 
meetings/seminars in which smaller groups can focus on issues of particular 
interest or enhance their understanding of a particular issue.  Seminars 
would be more in depth than what is possible in current group meeting format. 
                       3. Continue to enhance the information retrieval 
system so it  is easier to locate useful material (i.e. submissions, filings, 
etc.).                        4. Continue to emphasize to the commercial 
group  (at all levels) the value to Enron of  involving  government affairs 
in every major transaction  (value enhancing, risk mitigating) -  this should 
become the practice rather than the 
exception.

Attached are drafts of the agreements we need to execute to allow us to be in a position to transact.  Part of the input into these agreements are credit terms.  I am coordinating with our credit group to get those.

Given our respective processes, it is unlikely that we can execute a transaction this week.  However, once these agreements are in place we can, upon short notice, finalize a transaction.

Please have your attorney review these documents.  I will work on the credit terms.

Free Seminar: ""Optimization Model for Capital Investment Decisions
Using Option Pricing"", by INFORMS President John Birge

You are invited to attend a free, 45-minute online seminar on
""Optimization model for capital investment decisions using option
pricing"".

When: Wednesday, July 19, at 2:00 PM EDT

Where: Right from your desktop! You can participate using your office
computer and telephone.

How: <http://www.e-optimization.com/resources/web_realoptions.cfm>

Real-option valuation incorporates the opportunities a company may enjoy
using either new knowledge or changes in the marketplace for making
capital investments. The talk focuses on optimization models for
determining best investment levels and demonstrates how stochastic
(involving random variables) programs consider risk without creating
unwieldy formulations. Hear how Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and General
Motors are using this process successfully.

INFORMS President John Birge, Dean of the McCormick School of
Engineering and Applied Science at the Northwestern University in
Illinois, will give the seminar. John is a popular author and speaker
and during the past five years has been in demand for his talks on
stochastic programming and optimization.

Who should attend: OR analysts, strategic planners, financial analysts,
consultants and financial decision makers or anyone interested in
hearing about innovative, exciting, practical decision-making tools.

Yesterday we moved positions from several futures brokers to Fimat Derivatives Canada.  We had an account there previously, A/C # K2300.

They are requesting account documentation forms be signed today because our prior account with them was under HSBC and they want to get it directly in the name of Enron North America.

They are e-mailing account forms to me today and I will forward to both of you as soon as I receive.

Gary and Jeff Shankman requested that we move positions to FIMAT.

1. Introduction

Rotation abounds on the Big Chart as some of the formerly
weak groups are showing some signs of life, while some of
the stronger groups are starting to see their high
percentile rankings slip.  Speculation about lower interest
rates, a growing consensus that the Nasdaq has established
a bottom, and seasonal factors are all spurring the
reallocation of investment dollars.

Industry Group Analysis is just another of the many great
reasons to be a subscriber to the WallStreetCity website.

2. Groups that are Heating Up

This week's analysis starts right at the top of the Big
Chart with the banking sector.  All three industry groups
within the sector - Banks {.BAN}, Banks/Savings & Loan
{.BSL}, and Banks/Savings Banks {.BSB} - saw their
respective rankings rise last week.  The primary driver
behind this move was an improved interest rate outlook,
though Joe Morford at Dain Rauscher Wessels noted that
merger activity is picking up.  Among the best performers
were Century South {CSBI} (announced merger with BB&T
{BBT}), Charter One Financial {CF}, Imperial Bancorp {IMP}
(testing resistance), and Comerica {CMA}.

Selected groups within the electronics sector improved their
rankings.  Electronics/Motors rebounded back to the 85th
percentile after briefly dropping from green to yellow, two
weeks ago.  The group is being powered by electronics
conglomerate Emerson {EMR}, which set a new record high.
The Electronics/Semiconductors {.ESE} group seems to have
found a bottom, though it still remains among the worst
performing industry groups.  Nonetheless, it's worth noting
that the group's ranking has fallen below the tenth
percentile just twice since the beginning of October.
Electronics/Specialty instruments began its recovery after
posting a big drop on the Big Chart two weeks ago, with
gains by Zygo {ZIGO}, Newport Corporation {NEWP}, and
Trimble Navigation {TRMB}.

Other industry groups that gained ground last week include
Chemicals {.CHE}, Computer/Components {DCO},
Drugs/Biotechnology {.DBI}, Leisure/Race Tracks {.LRT},
Retail/Stores/Discount {.RDI}, and Retail/Stores/Specialty
{.RSP}, which improved its ranking for the fourth consecutive
week.

____________________________________________________________

3. Groups that are Cooling Off

Market sentiment finally coalesced with respect to the
entire utilities sector, and that sentiment was toward
profit taking.  Utilities/Diversified {.UDI} fell out of the
top quintile for the first time in five weeks and only the
second time since the beginning of October.  PG&E {PCG} fell
by more than 10 percent after the president of the California
Public Utilities Commission, Lorretta Lynch, said that
requests for electric rate increases by PCG and Southern
California Edison were premature.  Utilities/Gas/Producer-Gatherer
{.UPG} also dropped out of the top quintile, while
Utilities/Electric/Holding {.UHO} is threatening to turn from
green to yellow.

The beverage sector - which includes Beverages {.BEV},
Beverages/Beer & Ale {.BBA}, Beverages/Bottlers {.BBO},
Beverages/Distillers {.BDI}, Beverages/Soft Drink Syrup
{.BSD} - weakened as investors began funneling more money
into the tech sector.

Other groups that that fell on the Big Chart include
Energy/Oil-Gas/Domestic {.ODO}, Leisure/Casinos-Gaming {.LCG},
Vehicles/Truck-Trailers {.ATT}, and Homes/Hotels-Motels-Inns
{.HOT} - a group that we noted last week was likely to fall.

4. On the Radar Screen this Week

The retail sector could be worth watching over the next few
weeks as holiday shopping picks up.  Though many stores are
relying on discounts to draw in consumers, certain industry
groups within the sector have been improving their rankings;
these groups include Retail/Stores/Department {.RDE},
Retail/Stores/Discount {.RDI}, and the aforementioned
Retail/Stores/Specialty {.RSP}.  Stocks that are performing
well in these groups include Footstar {FTS}, Bebe Stores
{BEBE} and Target {TGT}.

____________________________________________________________

5. Stock In Focus

Foostar {FTS} has more than survived the volatility of the
past several weeks with a six-week gain of 32.0 percent. The
company saw same-store sales increase 13.5 percent in
November and could be on its way to posting a strong December;
particularly since FTS has a history of exceeding analyst
expectations by notable margins.  Footstar operates the
Footaction and Just for Feet chains and, last month, agreed
to acquire the footwear division of J. Baker {JBAK}.

Subject: Officializing Risk Books

Irena - Please forward to all in Risk Management:



In the last few weeks there have been numerous occasions in which certain 
risk books have not been officialized.  Most of these instances have been due 
to oversight; one instance was at the direction of Commercial.

I want to re-emphasise the importance of ensuring that all risk books are 
officialized at the end of the day.  This is the only mechanism we have to 
ensure that all trading positions are included in the Daily Position Report 
and daily trading limit calculations, both of which are reviewed by top Enron 
management on a daily basis.  This must be a top priority for Risk Management 
and we need to do whatever we have to do to make sure we remember to perform 
this function at the end of every day.  Furthermore, it is totally 
unacceptable for Commercial to direct any book administrator to not 
officialize a risk book.  If this occurs again and you are uncomfortable with 
dealing with the situation, please inform your Desk Controller, Steve Jackson 
or myself immediately and we will address the issue.

I realise every one of you has a lot on your plate and are working 
significant hours to get your jobs done.  However, let's do what we have to 
do to make sure that this basic responsibility of Risk Management is 
performed every day without any exceptions.

you are aware, this project is extremely high priority.  John Lavorato is 
expecting that several new reports be available as soon as possible.

We agreed that Hal would be fully dedicated to this project and the Risk

project now and will continue to be until it is completed.  I would actually 
like his to sit with our group at least until the project is complete.

Dear Ms. Geman,

I met with Vince Kaminski yesterday regarding picking back up with the 
license agreement we were working on back in March.  He relayed some 
additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement, which 
include the following:

 1. The price agreed upon is $90,000.
 2. D-G will provide system support.
3. No later than 12 months of execution of the agreement, D-G will provide 
the source code to Enron.  In the meantime, the source code is to be in 
escrow.  Additionally, the source code would be released sooner than the 12 
months if any of the following conditions occur:  (i) D-G goes out of 
business; (ii) D-G is unable to provide effective technical support; or (iii) 
if D-G agrees to release it sooner.

Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to 
discuss the escrow situation.  Vince mentioned that you had suggested that 
your attorney keep the software in escrow.   Is your attorney a U.S. 
attorney?  It seems like I may have recalled that way back in March you might 
have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney.  Is that the 
same person?  Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo 
practitioner?  Basically, if you could just provides some additional 
information about your attorney, I would appreciate it.

We normally would use an Escrow company to put the software in escrow.  We 
have dealt with a company here in the U.S. called DSI Technology.  I will 
check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney.

Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow, 
we will red-line the agreement to reflect such changes and e-mail it back to 
you for your review.

I look forward to hearing from you.

You don't believe everything Tana tells you, do you?  Haven't you realized she's just trying to get out of work?  At least now you know who really does the work in the Swap Group.

We will prepare your CA for you (since Tana won't).  Will you send Poli-Twine's address and fax number?

Thanks!

Marie

Through my conversations with Tana, I understand that there is a change in the Confidentiality Agreement.  Thus, I am sending this information to all of you.

Mr. Dave Beazer

He would like to have the CA sent via facsimile to dbeazer@politwine.com <mailto:dbeazer@politwine.com>.  I can forward it to him once I have a draft that is acceptable with Legal..  Thanks for your help.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Sorry for the slow response.  

I don't have a strong opinion either way.  I am fine with the combo idea.

In the future, please let me know if something has a short fuse.  I am still 
slower on email but I do respond very quickly to voicemail.  I am almost 
caught up on back log emails but this will probably never by my first and 
best way to communcate.

Richard Bianchi has proposed August 20 for the arbitration, which he believes 
will not last more than a day..  Does that work for you and our possible 
witnesses,if any? Short of the offtakers, which Max is concerned about 
involving, who would you have in mind--since we are posturing  this as an msj 
case?  If the date works, I would suggest that we try to depose McKenna as 
soon as possible to see if there is any additional discovery we really need. 
Let me hear from you'all and then I'll ask Tom to contact the other 
arbitrators about their availability and the preparation of some kind of 
scheduling order for discovery, motions, etc. deadlines.

0,"Nick,
I am not sure what happened to this volume.   I cannot tell by the audit 
trail, but there is a connection between meter HPL meter 987283,  and MIDT 
989807.   The volume you are referring to is on Mid-Tex Pipeline under meter 
989807.   It it pathed as a point to point nom with no deal reference.   I do 
not think this is correct because the deal you reference show HPLC as 
purchaser.   The volume is in MIPS under meter 989807, but  the supply deal 
is set up on HPL meter 987283, and the audit trail in Sitara shows the deal 
was moved from MIDT to HPL.   Get with Thu when she returns to see if she 
knows anything about this.

Hi Sherlyn,

Could you check to see why the volumes at this meter were zeroed out for the 
above months.  We paid Richardson back then and yesterday I noticed that we 
have a recoverable amount for the entire amounts paid for each month.  The 
sitara Deal #s are 127856 for Nov and 131729 for Dec.  Let me know if you

0,"As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer 
to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are 
discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand 
the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and 
distribution partners.

We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading 
provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out 
the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in 
December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service 
we created.

However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the 
quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new 
on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our 
service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated 
basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment 
on-demand independently.

We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for 
delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive 
about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you 
apprised of our progress."

presence and participation shows the field teams the environmental commitment 
from Houston. 

Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations.  The second 
moring will be devoted to a  ""surprise"" participation at a local compressor 
station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque.  I havent spread this around yet, 
except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but  I plan on dividing the guys into 
groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor 
station.  I plan on setting and hiding  some placebo environmental issues the 
night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other 
housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.  We will then convine 
back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they 
would address the issues identified.  The group that identifies the most 
issues, will get a small gift.  Do I need your approval on the spending of 
some $$$ for a gift?  I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for 
the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they 
want.  The final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental 
situations under varying circumstances, like we did last year with the whole 
group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams.

The 7849 are all in-the-money financial counterparties and all physical deals we are performing on.  We have gotten shorter because that is not all positions we are reporting.  To the true DPR we are reporting additional books but we were told for this purpose you only wanted the deals we plan to perform on.  We don't need the East/West for gas.  I will fill in those additional columns for tomorrows report.  Will you be sending out a new form or shall I make the changes?  Do you want an email daily or have you set up a file for these to be saved into?

Is that all of ENA Gas?(We can do away with the East and West and just report it as US)  Have we really gotten that much shorter from 11/30, when we were (219) BCF short?  2) Can you also provide the p&l numbers for columns Q through T?

The value in the table is the beginning balance for each month.  So if they 
cancel in the middle of the month, they should pay the balance at the 
beginning of that month and no prorated minimum monthly fee.  If you prorate 
it on both ends, you end up getting the total balance shown at the beginning 
of the month.

What is the status of the Yazoo City master gas agreement?  Do we still want

Subject: Open items for MDEA

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Here's the latest I have, but there may be another turn in the works.  I've 
asked Pete to send it to you, along with the GE.  I need to do an override 
letter to pick up the agency stuff as well.  I spoke with Lisa about that

we can have them sent to NEPCo so long as they go to Jody for payment.  There

0,"Dear Sir,

I understand that Enron has just terminated
negotiations with regard to leasing some 1.5 million
sq.ft. of space at Canary Wharf in London.

I would like you to consider the London Dome. This has
sufficient space for all your needs, would provide a
high profile location, and I can put together a
package which would be financially extremely
beneficial to Enron.

Please reply to me at samberkovits@yahoo.com

ergy=20
Crisis

Dean Tyson:

It was a pleasure to see you again today. Phil, it was a pleasure to meet y=
ou=20
and I look forward to working together.  Since time is of the essence, I=20
wanted to summarize where we left off at today=01,s meeting regarding Calif=
ornia=01,
s energy crisis.  That summary is attached.  I've also attached three=20
articles from the business section of today's Chronicle that arguably bolst=
er=20
our arguments for adopting the approach that we discussed at today's meetin=
g.

 Given the fact that the legislative process is moving rapidly, bankruptcy =
is=20
a daily threat, and Dean Tyson will be attending the meetings in Davos, it=
=20
appears that our window of opportunity is very small.  It seems that succes=
s=20
requires a meeting of the principals by the end of the week, if not sooner.=
 =20
The chances of success are obviously limited, but I think that we agreed th=
at=20
all concerned have nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking a shot.=
=20
Your offer to help in the effort obviously increases the likelihood of=20
success and is greatly appreciated. =20

My apologies in advance if I have mischaracterized any of the points made a=
t=20
the meeting.  It represents a =01&first cut,=018 it will undoubtedly change=
 as the=20
details get worked out, and I=01,m sure I=01,ve missed something.  So pleas=
e don=01,t=20
hesitate to edit the draft.

Please keep in mind that I have not had a chance to discuss this proposal=
=20
internally.  As such, I can=01,t yet commit Enron to the specifics of the=
=20
proposal.  But I=01,m confident that the company can support something akin=
 to=20
this structure and can let you and Phil know first thing Monday.

In addition, given the political environment in California, Enron has playe=
d=20
a constructive role by providing low-key, behind the scenes advice and=20
analysis to policy makers.  That approach seems preferable in this effort a=
s=20
well.

Finally, Dean Tyson, I mentioned that Linda Robertson heads-up our Washingt=
on=20
D.C. office.  If she can help in any way, please don=01,t hesitate to let m=
e=20
know.  Both of you should feel free to call me at home over the weekend to=

discuss things further.  My home phone is 415.621.8317.

Subject: Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent

With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to 
follow):

Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty 
name in GCP.  The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90 
characters.  I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if 
the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical 
power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set 
the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the 
special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline 
and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.

LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY:  Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as 
authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power 
Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company

SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP:   Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent

Calif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy Suits
Dow Jones Newswires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday
he is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energy
suppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity.

But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigation
he has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he has
discovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibiting
overcharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time.

Lockyer's disclosure came a week after the state's top law enforcement
official sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling and
forcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection.

The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area to
overcome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press.

""We've devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get back
the money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added.

Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his office
has subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Reliant
Energy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorney
general did mention Enron by name, saying ""we're still looking at the energy
overcharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.

Enron, a major energy trading concern, has filed for bankruptcy protection
following the disclosure that it misstated its earnings by hundreds of
millions of dollars.

PG&E, the only supplier Lockyer has sued, blamed its woes on a 1996
California law that left it unable to collect the full price of electricity
from its customers.

Lockyer's disclosure that he hasn't discovered criminal conduct, including
no evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices, comes nearly a year after he said
he wanted to jail Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman. Lockyer told the Wall
Street Journal in May that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8
by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is
Spike, honey.""'

On Wednesday, Lockyer declared the statement ""rhetorical excess,"" adding,
""So far...we haven't found criminal behavior associated with pricing
policies.""

Still, the city of San Francisco has accused 13 energy suppliers of
manipulating prices in a suit that is pending in San Diego County Superior
Court.

That suit alleges the suppliers manipulated supplies to keep prices high.
San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Mark Slavin said the city doesn't have
proof of those allegations, but would uncover them as the lawsuit proceeds
in a process known as discovery.

""We think that the discovery process will uncover anticompetitive behavior,""
Slavin said.

The energy suppliers have denied the allegations.

A California legislative committee also investigating a spike in wholesale
energy costs has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the
Wholesale Energy Market summoned Enron officials to appear for depositions
regarding destruction of documents. Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, and the
committee's chairman, said he's concerned that documents destroyed by
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, were covered by a legislative subpoena
issued in June.

Dunn's committee on Wednesday also agreed to subpoena Andersen regarding the
Enron records.

As an Enron shareholder, I fully appreciate that we need explosive growth and profitability out of EES, particularly with reduced volatility in gas and power markets over the next several years.

I am commited to ensuring that the retail risk management organization is offered all the tools, information, systems, competitive pricing, etc. to allow EES to offer fully bundled competitively priced products to retail customers.

Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).

Val was looking into this deal, but now that she's gone I wonder if you could 
help me with it. It's a swap that was done on 10/18/99 between LTWM and EES. 
It's an off-peak deal for 0.2 mw at a price of $23.00 and settlement index of 
PX SP-15. There are five legs that each run for one year - Cal'05 through 
Cal'09. 

I understand you've been working on making the switch from PX to Dow Jones 
indices. Do you know anything about this deal and whether or not its index 
needs to be changed? Please let Melissa or me know.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

0,"Dear Jeff,

Our tiger team very much enjoyed your presentation about Enron Global Markets 
on Friday.  Given that we have latitude in our project scope, our team would 
like to assist Enron in evaluating a new market opportunity.  You mentioned 
several markets that Enron is considering in 2001, including transportation, 
cement, coffee, cocoa, sugar, etc.  We believe that a project of this sort 
will give us the opportunity to really learn how Enron creates value, what 
its business model and core competencies are, and how they can be translated 
to a new market.  Furthermore, we can get an in-depth understanding of an 
industry.  We believe our project will complement any analysis that your 
business group is currently undertaking.  Please propose the top three new 
markets that you would like us to evaluate for Enron.

Upon receipt of your proposal, perhaps we could set up a conference call to 
discuss your thoughts and to make a final selection.

Your expeditious response is appreciated.

Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of 
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power 
crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share 
of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of 
California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private 
energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the 
state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting 
to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting 
against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and 
simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most 
of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying 
the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators 
who have also gouged California. 
""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across 
their face because they are robbing us blind,"" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state 
Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from 
Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are 
made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually 
used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most 
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and 
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped 
as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events 
that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover 
from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in 
receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, 
an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents 
subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged 
market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, 
received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged 
higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 
million.

Yesterday he took me to his house on one of the small islands on Lake Nicaragua.  He owns his own island.  There are about 300 of them.  Too rustic for me, but very peaceful. He arranged my travel from Granada to the Blue Bay Resort at Papaguyo Beach in Costa Rica.  It is only three or four hours away driving, but is a hassle because you have to cross the border.

went off on her.  I actually didn't watch the game as i was at the OSU game. 
We went to the peacock and drank some beers with Carter (who owns it now)  We 
partied most of the morning and then went to the game.  Then a bunch of us 
went down to Eugene and partied and i stayed the night at Wilson and Cindys.  
Deidre and Stephan were there too.  It was really fun.  Sunday sucked cause i 
was really hung over and had to be up to portland by noon to play golf with 
kim but a few beers on the course and I felt great.  Speaking of you picking 
up on chicks Amanda told me a pretty interesting story last week of you 
trying to pick up on her a couple of times.  So lets see, do I have any 
friends (male or female) that you didn't try to pick up on while we were 
dating! :)    Frankly I was very  embarassed when she told me. VERY NICE 
Katie!   Good thing Dave is a good sport.  I did see the articles about 
capital consultants.  Grayson  is lucky he isn't wearing a set of cement

would like to have cleared up by Monday afternoon.  For example, is CRRA 
filing alone or are we filing jointly?

I believe we've covered all the issues outlined by Sandra.  Please let me

apparently
succesful policy to promote growth.

ECONOMIC VIEWPOINT
'Bribe' Third World Parents to Keep Their Kids in School
GARY S. BECKER

        Many well-meaning Americans, including college students and religious
organizations, have attacked Nike Inc. and other companies accused of
using child labor in their overseas plants in poor nations. I agree that
something should be done to save the children from dismal long-term
economic prospects. However, effective policies must recognize that the
fundamental cause of child labor is poverty, not greedy foreign and
domestic employers. To combat the effects of poverty, poor mothers
should be ''bribed'' to keep their children in school longer.

        Really poor families in Brazil, Mexico, Zaire, India, and many other
nations put their children to work because their meager earnings help
provide basic food and medicine for themselves and younger siblings.
Although parents may recognize that schooling would improve their
children's marketable labor skills later in life, they cannot afford the
''luxury'' of taking them out of the labor market. In essence, child
labor is the result of a conflict between short-term parental economic
interests and the long-term interests of the children.

        Adequate economic growth always eliminates child labor even without
laws

against it. But poor nations needn't wait until they grow richer. There
are short-term solutions. Many nations have compulsory schooling laws up
to age 15 or so, but they are often hard to enforce, especially in rural
areas and poor sections of large cities. Families who want their
children to work simply do not send them to school, or the children have
very high absenteeism rates. Officials are reluctant to punish parents
of working children, perhaps because they recognize that the problem is
not selfishness but poverty.

        SHARE THE BURDEN. I propose a better way: Give parents a financial
incentive to keep their children in school longer. Poor mothers should
be paid if schools certify that their children attend classes regularly.
Parents would be strongly motivated to send their children to
school--even when the children do not want to go--if these payments were
not much below what the children could earn. Most poor parents would
happily continue.

        [A few sentences were cut here.  I think they describe Progresa 
program
in Mexico.  I think this program pays a few dozen dollars a month to families
that keep kids in school and immunized.]
Most poor Mexican families earn only about $100 a
month. That large a percentage increase should have a noticeable effect
on their behavior.

        Poor families in less developed nations whose children do go to school
are likely to withdraw their daughters when they become teenagers. This
tends to perpetuate economic inequalities, since the children of women
who receive little schooling also tend to be badly educated. Progresa
tries to combat this tendency to favor education of older sons by paying
a little more to families that keep teenage daughters enrolled.

        NARROW THE GAP. This pioneering Mexican approach appears to be highly
successful. An evaluation prepared for an October economics conference
in Chile shows that after only a couple of years, Progresa significantly
raised the schooling of children in very poor Mexican families. It has
also narrowed the education gap between girls and boys and reduced the
labor force participation of boys.

        Of course, governments need to find the tax revenue to finance
programs
like Progresa. A good start would be to recognize that Mexico and many
other less developed nations typically spend disproportionately on
universities and other education of their elites. Redistributing some of
this spending to the poor would both reduce inequality and stimulate
faster economic growth. Widespread basic education is more effective in
promoting economic development than generous subsidies to the richer
students who attend universities.

        Child-labor critics could spend their time more fruitfully by
attacking
not the overseas employment policies of multinationals but the social
policies of governments in poor nations that are really responsible for
the prevalence of child labor there. These governments, and perhaps
international organizations such as the World Bank, should follow
Mexico's example and introduce programs that pay poor mothers to keep
their teenage and younger sons and daughters in school and out of the
labor force.

																					Public Offered Units of Williams 
																					Energy Partners
																					
																					
																					
																					?  ? Williams will offer the public a 32% stake in its Williams  Energy 
Partners petroleum storage and distribution partnership.  Williams Energy 
Partners filed with the SEC to register 3.75 million  common units, which 
will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol  'WEG'. Williams will own 68% of 
the Williams Energy partnership  after the sale. The partnership consists of 
four petroleum products  terminals along the Gulf Coast and the New York 
harbor, 24 inland  petroleum product terminals and an ammonia pipeline. 
Lehman Brothers  will underwrite the sale which is expected to begin next 
January.  The estimated total proceeds would be about $90 million if the  
underwriters exercise an option to sell an additional 562,500 units  if 
needed to meet investor demand. If that overallotment option is  
																					
																					
																					
																					
																																									
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																exercised, the public would have a 37% stake in the  partnership. The four 
marine terminals have a storage capacity of  more than 17.6 million barrels. 
The 1,100 mile-long pipeline  transports and distributes ammonia from 
production facilities in  Texas and Oklahoma to various distribution points. 
Ammonia is  produced from natural gas and is used primarily as a nitrogen  
fertilizer. Williams did not name an individual price for the common  units. 
It would expect to receive net proceeds of about $70 million  from the sale 
of the 3.75 million common units, based on a?  unit price of $20. WEG will 
use the proceeds, together with $90  million from its line of credit, to 
repay $156 million of debt owned  to Williams. Williams Energy will offer 
holders of the units a  quarterly distribution of $0.52 per unit each 
quarter. Last week,  Williams said third-quarter profit more than quadrupled, 
beating  estimates.

																																		DTE,  MCN Merger to Close Next Year 
																																		
																																		
																																		? ?  DTE Energy Holding says it is unlikely that the merger with MCN  Energy 
Group will close this year. The delay is due to the  companies' decision to 
sell a portion of MCN's natural gas  distribution capacity to a unit of 
Exelon, which is subject to  Michigan PSC review.

Subject: URGENT STOP PAYMENT: Writ of Garnishment of money due CIGSA served 
on EECC on April 10

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

This Saturday morning, Brad, and volunteers (anyone who wants to help - bring your shovel and come along) will be landscaping the area, with funds donated by the owner of the property.  The landscaping is being done in an effort to discourage future dumpings in this spot.

		 Subject: Direct Access - Potential Cost Savings

This memo lays out some numbers with regard to the question raised earlier 
this week concerning the savings to CDWR if direct access were to be 
reinstated.

Using available annual mWh sales figures for PG&E and SCE (1999), commercial 
and industrial sales as a percentage of total sales is 63% for PGE and 68% 
for SCE, or, in terms of annual mWh purchases, approximately 63,900,000 kWh 
for PGE and 61,200,000 kWh for SCE for a total C&I purchase requirement of 
125,100,000 kWh.

Assuming that every kWh of C&I load that switches to direct access is an 
equivalent reduction in CDWR purchase requirements (which assumes that CDWR 
fills 100% of the net short) and bracketing CDWR per unit purchase costs 
between its published portfolio cost and an assumed market price of $250 per 
kWh, the following cost reductions (stated on a monthly basis) are shown 
below:


		Per Month Purchase Cost Reduction
Switch to Direct Access	CDWR Portfolio Cost - $79/mWh	Market Price - $250/mWh
5%	$41mm	$130 mm
10%	$ 82 mm	$260 mm
15%	$123 mm	$390 mm
20%	$164 mm	$420 mm

If you have any questions with regard to the above or require further 
analysis please advise.

Vince,

Just to update you on how things are going with regard to EOL -

I had a meeting with John Arnold yesterday to show him what had been 
accomplished to date, and I think that he was fairly impressed by the 
information available. I asked him for his input, and he expressed his 
interest in having a couple of reports made up that couldn't be created from 
the format the data was in. I spoke to Clayton about this, and he has already 
made changes that will reflect a number of the modifications John requested.

I am also continuing to research the issue of an automated trading platform 
for EOL. I have some information about how the NASDAQ operates, and I have 
looked at some websites for ECNs, such as Archipelago, Island and Instinet. I 
have also had a look at the International Securities Exchange (ISE) web-site, 
but they do not seem to explain much about their system. Any further 
suggestions would be appreciated.

I want to find out more about where EOL is currently and what modifications 
may be necessary in the existing system, finish reading the material at the 
websites I have investigated, and then I will try to put together a 
presentation for you and/or Greg Whalley.

Tom

I ran SettleGen for 4/1 and 4/2.  These appeared to return meter data in correct form.  I then ran SettleGen for 4/23-25 and these are the results I received:

4/23/01:  HE 1 = meter data
	  HE 2-24 = 0

4/24/01: HE 1= 0
	 HE 2-24 = meter data

4/25/01: HE 1 = meter data
	 HE 2-24 = 0

I understand that with the Daylight savings, there is a one hour shift, thus explaining the HE 2 on 4/23 finishing HE 1 on 4/24. I confirmed that there is meter data available for 4/23 & 4/24.  There is no meter available for 4/25 (that's another issue).  It seems that the pull is skipping a whole day.  

One other thing that I checked:
I pulled meter from the Settledb from qyrMeterDstGen_Interval for 4/24 and ran SettleGen for 4/24.  The qyr meter data HE 1-23 is equal to the SettleGen data for HE 2-24.  

If you could please call me at your earliest convenience so we can get this taken care of today if possible.

THANK YOU ANNA!!!

0,"Cal-ISO seeks forward contracting authority
  
09/20/2000 
Generation Week 
(c) Copyright 2000 Pasha Publications, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
The California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) ""most reluctantly"" asked 
FERC last week to approve tariff amendments that would allow the system 
operator to obtain forward contracts. 
Further, in an effort to discourage utilities from leaning on the ISO for 
power, The ISO wants to allocate the costs of those contracts to scheduling 
coordinators whose forward schedules do not reflect their actual real-time 
demands. The allocation of those costs would be proportional to the sizes of 
the deviations. This would be a change from the current system, in which 
energy purchasing to balance load is spread among all market participants. 
""Fairness, as well as providing appropriate economic incentives to scheduling 
coordinators to align their forward and real-time schedules, dictates this 
allocation,"" the Cal-ISO's filing states. 
Recently, Cal-ISO President and CEO Terry Winter had unsuccessfully sought 
approval from the ISO Board of Governors to approve an amendment to the ISO's 
tariff to require scheduling coordinators to include at least 90% of actual 
loads, with generation and imports sufficient to balance their schedules, in 
final day-ahead schedules, and 95% of actual load in final hour-ahead 
schedules. Scheduling coordinators would have had to bear the costs of the 
ISO's out-of-market power purchases to balance the load. Coordinators would 
have been allocated the costs of those arrangements in proportion to the 
deviations of their actual real-time loads from their scheduled loads (GW 
8/30). 
The ISO is asking for authority to enter into forward contracts without first 
soliciting bids because a formal bid process would take too long in a 
fast-moving market. 
FERC has directed the ISO to enter into forward contracts as a means of 
better assuring that load requirements are met. FERC expressed its concern in 
an order refusing San Diego Gas & Electric's request for a cap of indefinite 
duration on energy sold in the California Power Exchange. FERC ordered ""the 
ISO to immediately institute a more forward approach to procuring the 
resources necessary to reliably operate the grid."" 
The ISO said it is in total agreement with FERC's observation that a 
reasonable supply portfolio would make use of forward contracting as a hedge 
against price volatility. The ISO noted that the grid operator and FERC are 
in agreement that fulfillment of forward contracting is a responsibility that 
best resides with load-serving utilities. 
""Unfortunately, and for reasons not at all apparent to the ISO, the utilities 
thus far have been denied that authority,"" the Cal-ISO filing stated, noting 
the decision to empower the utilities rests California Public Utilities 
Commission. The ISO said it is applying for the tools to enter into forward 
contracts, but expressed hope that load-serving entities would ""receive and 
exercise the authority to discharge a responsibility that more properly is 
theirs."" 
The ISO said it doesn't want to be placed in the position as a competing 
market player. 
""The ISO continues to believe that its market activities should be 
constrained to an absolute minimum and that, most particularly, it should not 
be competing against load-serving entities for the energy needed to satisfy 
load that is reasonably predictable,"" the Cal-ISO said. 
The Cal-ISO wants forward contracting authority because the grid operator 
needs to buy increasing amounts of power at the last minute to balance supply 
and load on the grid. The ISO has been scrambling through real-time and 
ancillary services markets to find this balancing power. 
Originally, the California market system was set up so that utilities would 
buy most of the state's power needs through the California Power Exchange's 
(Cal-PX) day-ahead market. State regulators have not given utilities 
authority to do extensive forward contracting outside the Cal-PX, and 
utilities have been increasingly inclined to under schedule their actual 
needs in the Cal-PX and lean on the ISO to provide the balance of the power 
for their customers. 
Saying that underscheduling of load continues to be a problem and cautioning 
that unseasonably warm days occur in the fall, the ISO asked FERC to waive 
the typical 60-day notice required for tariff amendments and allow the 
changes to take effect immediately. 
""What the ISO seeks are the tools necessary to enable it to contract if 
available forward commitments appear reasonable,"" the system operator's 
filing says. The ISO said it does not believe other, related FERC orders 
require it to forward contract. "

with historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as 
well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer

Have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to

The following summarizes the decisions made during our  user & IT joint 
meeting today regarding the handling of CES historical data.

A.  Bryce Baxter will coordinate with all user groups to identify CES reports 
that need to be actually printed as hard copy or transfered to files that 
will be accessed               via the Electronic Document Management system.
B.  Jeff Peoples will be working with Bryce Baxter to produce reports using 
CES system via ISDN line at Enron building - this will continue to be part of 
his duty until  the job is done (Jeff joined ENA as a member of Sitara group).
C.  Larry Daze will be working with Jeff Peoples and Bryce Baxter to ensure 
all reports are loaded on our EDMS with proper indexing.
D.  No need for manupulating CES history data is necessary  (i.e. downloading 
on spreadsheets).  Therefore, no data will be kept on the disk other than 
EDMS.

The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Mar. 14
Beginning today through 3/19, the Corporate Security team will replace the GRC.dat file in W:\scripts\UpdateGRC and W:\scripts\logon\Win2000\original to point NAV clients on nahou-apnav01 to nahou-apnav02 (only about 650 left).  No impact is expected.

Mar. 15
From 11:00 - 11:15 a.m., the Corporate Security group will remove the svceu_SAPConnect account from CORP Domain Admins group.  No impact is expected.

Mar. 15
From 4:00 - 6:00 p.m.., the Unix Team will upgrade the Time server.  Timex.ect.enron.com which is now on a Unix desktop network will be moved to a production network and to Netra T1 hardware. It would be doing the same activity as Rolex which was replaced on Monday. All clients are now pointing to new Rolex server & Timex.  No impact is expected.  

Mar. 15
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will replace the switch on the Extranet link HOPIX1.  This change will cause intermittent outages for those external companies using this link to access the Enron Network.

Mar. 15
From 8:00 p.m. through 3/17 at 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will re-enable the File Replication Service on all Corporate domain controllers.  This change is necessary to replicate security policies.   FRS will be started on Corp DCs one at a time, watching to be sure replication completes.  Brief outages of Corp.enron.com security policies and possibly Exchange may occur.  The Messaging team will be notified if replication causes problems.  Support staff whose applications experience problems due to FRS should contact the solution center at ext. 54745.
Mar. 15
From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Corporate Server team will place Nahou-appr1 into the Corp Domain.  This change will affect applications using the R drive. 
Mar. 16
From 10:00 - 11:00 p.m., Telephony Services will perform the monthly maintenance on the CMS (Call management) systems.  This maintenance affects only call center reporting.  No impact to users is expected.
Mar. 16
From 2:00 - 4:00 p.m., the Blackberry Network Team will perform maintenance on a component of the Blackberry Network.  Some customers may experience delays in receiving messages.  It is also possible that messages sent from he Blackberry may be returned.  Returned messages can be resent after the maintenance is complete.
Mar. 18
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will change the DHCP scopes to update the secondary WINS and DNS entries.  This change will affect workstations that get their IP addresses via DHCP.  All scopes are renewed on a 24-hour basis so all changes should be completed by 3/19.  No impact is expected.
May 1
At 5:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will remove access to CORPHOU-DC07 (172.23.226.23, primary/secondary DNS) and NAHOU-NSWN03 (172.23.226.24, primary/secondary WINS) from devices within ECN.   All servers/workstations/equipment using these for WINS/DNS must have their settings changed. Use 172.16.7.120 for DNS and 172.16.7.116 for WINS in their place by this 5/01.

0,"I updated that systems matrix recently, in preparation for our much 
rescheduled meeting with AA on risk controls.  That is on my calendar for 
Friday morning this week, so I will bring copies with me to that meeting.  

I have been publishing an ENA operations report monthly since June.  To date, 
I have been reviewing it with Dave Delainey, fine-tuning each month the types 
of information and format that he likes.  I will bring you a copy tomorrow 
and would like your input on content and format as well.  With the recent 
reorganization, I am working with EGM and EIM to create the same report.  
After we have mastered that here in Houston over the next month or so, I plan 
to share the format with London so that all of our wholesale businesses can 
use the same format.  

In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily 
report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track 
compliance with our fundamental operating standards.  We are in the phase of 
determining the source of reporting (systematic or manual) and the frequency 
of reporting (daily, weekly, monthly) for all commodities and locations 
against the operating standards.  As we get this to a first draft stage, I 
will share this with you, as well as the timeline for full implementation.

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION'S REPORT

The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis' remarks on the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) report:

""My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity
affordable. That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this
complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in. I believe we are making
a good start.

""Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in
San Diego, and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable
power resources, like the photovotaic program you see behind us, to support
financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs
up and down the state to reduce California's use of electricity by 10% when
we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a
number of industries, including the technology and grocery industry that
reduce the demand on any given day.

""Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional. It is a very difficult
environment for deregulation to work. And I repeat again, deregulation can
work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is
competitive, which it is not.

""I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this
market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial
reports of the action that FERC took today. It is a mixed blessing. They do
recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree
that the rates are not just or reasonable. However, they did not, as I
encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who
were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that
San Diego had to suffer through.

""FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent
service operator, and the power exchange. FERC agrees with me that they are
self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market
manipulation. However, it is unclear what will replace those boards. The
good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is
dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust. The bad news is there is
no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California.

""I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going
to be a prisoner of ideology. I do not want some knee jerk reactions to
drive our economy or our consumers to their knees. I have seen time and
again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give
us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon
us.' So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the
moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for
electricity than we paid about 12 months ago. That has got to stop.

Question inaudible.

""It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this
again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with. Once the state
deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996, the PUC basically
surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of
electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision
today, they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake
holder members and they think that is ill advised, as do I. There will be
new boards established and we will tell you how they are established. So it
is unclear whether we have the authority to, independent of the FERC to
establish our own ISO and power exchange. My initial reading of the press
reports suggest that we may not. That is something that has to be cleared up
over the next several days.

Question inaudible.

""We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of
stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators, other consumer groups
from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate
the path that we will take. I am not at the point where I can tell you what
that consensus is. But we are making progress.

Question inaudible.

""That we are going to fight for consumers, that they should not bear the
full brunt of this experiment in deregulation. At best it was premature and
the market place was not prepared. The marketplace is dysfunctional, it is
not competitive. There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can
generate in this state. I want them to know that we are working night and
day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs
for this ill-conceived scheme.

""I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is
dysfunctional, recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable. I am not
pleased that they have not offered any solutions. It looks like we are going
to have to wait until November 9th at the hearing in front of FERC at which
their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment,
critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted
in full or in part. This is a very important meeting in which our
administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the
consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not
before.

""I believe refunds are due and necessary. FERC and the Secretary of Energy
have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and
reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds. It is
unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not. Congress
could settle

the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that. Over the long
haul, by that I mean 5 to 10 to 15 years, I believe deregulation can work
but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act
responsibly. As I told everyone involved in this process, some people may
win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and
citizen of this state. The people of California will stand up; they will
rise up and take matters into their own hands. The problem with deregulation
lowering rates, is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the
immediate horizon.

Question inaudible.

""Let me just say two things. I think there is plenty of blame to go around
but there is no question that the generators who happen to be out-of-state
companies are charging us 600 to 700% more for the very same electricity
that we purchased last year. You cannot add value to an electron. An
electron is an electron. They are simply taking advantage of an ill-advised
scheme envisioned in the 1996 act to charge what the market will bear. I am
standing up and saying no more. We are not going to take this lying down. We
are fighting back. The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we
used to have. The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson
signed the deregulation bill. Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored
by Steve Peace, they were the two driving forces as they will be happy, well
maybe not so happy, to acknowledge. It may have seemed like a good idea in
1996 but I did not participate in that debate and I don't have a comment on
whether it was a good idea then. But clearly in the year 2000 it is not a
good idea. Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some
limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the
generators which is about 35-40% of their facilities that they used to own
and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out
of state generators that purchased them. FERC has control over them and it
is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own
power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted. There is no
question about that. They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous
and do not represent consumer interests. Plus you cannot hold anyone
accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards. You
cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of
electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state. So
these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no
public official participates on those boards.

Question inaudible.

""You are more right than wrong. As the chief executive of this state I am
going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers
and businesses. Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy. Without water
and electricity, consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck.
Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in 1996 made sense then is a
question not worth debating today. But it does not make sense today.
Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in
1996 surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to
monitor and supervise. So it is unclear how much power is left to the state.
FERC seems to be suggesting

today, not much. Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as
much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable
and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility
that is laid at my doorstep.

""I have one goal in mind: to do our level best to make sure that our lights
stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the
prices are reasonable. What path we take to that matters less to me than
that we get to that result. Because that is the result that is necessary to
allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a
profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn
provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the
environment and provide healthcare. Without electricity there is no economic
growth, without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice
to our public obligations. Thank you for coming out here today.

Subject: New Reports from PIRA


To PIRA's Retainer Service Clients,
Attached are two strategic reports on the telecom industry that address the
burgeoning market for bandwidth and the implications for the energy
industry.
The first report, ""BROADBAND OR DEADBAND: An Appraisal of the Fledgling
Bandwidth Commodity Market,"" focuses on trading in the wholesale broadband
market.  To assist readers in navigating this report (as well as the second
report) a short glossary of terms can be found in its Appendix.
The second report, ""THE DASH FOR CASH: Lucrative Opportunities to Provide
High-Speed Internet Access,"" focuses on the means by which consumers will
access this communications capacity and some strategic opportunities for
energy companies.
We hope you find these reports useful and strategically provocative.  After
investing great effort in becoming conversant in this area, it is clear to
us at PIRA that the energy marketplace will be forever changed by the demand
for, and creation of, substantial broadband.  What is NOT clear to us at
this time is how we can best assist our clients that are looking to
participate in these developments.  In light of that, we ask that you take a
moment to complete the brief survey that is also attached to this email.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Dr. Gary N. Ross
Chief Executive Officer

Subject: RE: EFET Meeting with the CREG/Union Miniere feedback

 Ross, Paul

We had good feedback from Union Miniere on the Belgian situation yesterday.  
Apparently the Febeliec press release on the competitive situation in Belgium 
went down very badly in the government.  Febeliec got a letter back saying 
that the govt was ""disappointed and unhappy"" with the letter, noting that the 
govt priorities were the Belgian presidency of the EU, the finances of the 
communes (whose finances are of course completely wrapped up with 
Electrabel's extraction of revenues from captive customers) and something 
along the lines of ""preserving the traditions of Belgian electricity 
supply"".  Furthermore, there are suggestions of veiled threats (not from the 
government directly, but from those working closely with govt) of 
""retribution"" ( taxes/environmental burdens) -presumably if Febeliec don't 
lay off.  Also confirmed Bruno's CREG feedback that border issues are not a 
priority.

UM however is going to persist.  Senior management (Marcel Goetstouwers, VP 
of Purchasing & Transportation) wants us to go back next week and present to 
him why exactly we can't commit to delivering firm on the Belgian grid next 
year and what it takes for us to be able to do so.  He intends to use this 
material in his upcoming meeting with the Minister.  We have of course been 
explaining all along the difficulties, but it has taken their recent Belgian 
tender (in response to which they received no offers apart from their 
Electrabel offer plus our OTM option) for him to take the issues seriously.  
UM is also talking again about complaints to the Commission, which they may 
actually do now (possibly).  

Our OTM option remains on the table and we can discuss it again after their 
visit to the Minister.

Against this background, the CREG refusal to meet with Enron is obviously 
symptomatic of the general attitude of the govt.  EFET Belgium needs to take 
this into account in moving forward. (Bruno - why not get some feedback 
directly, and independently, from Febeliec - and see if it confirms or not 
UM's report.)

On the test sale to Electrabel on the Belgian grid, I will take this forward 
with Jonathan on his return on Tuesday.  Following the recent 
pressure/letters from us on the issue to CPTE, they had indicated ARP trading 
on the grid would be in place by 1 July but this has since slipped to Sep or 
Oct, and of course, there is no CPTE commitment on paper anyway (a promised 
press release on the subject is probably being saved for the announcement of 
the nomination of the TS0, expected 21 July).  It will be interesting to see 
if Electrabel still give us a price, since there have been CPTE/Electrabel 
discussions on the matter since we raised it.

Just to clarify, we can buy from Electrabel in Belgium, but are told we can 
not SELL to them in Belgium.  Perhaps an even more crazy situation!

BTW, we intend to challenge this by doing a deal and just submitting a

Bruno,

As you say not unexpected!  

Were they quoting the govt in terms of their intentions to not open the 
market?  How does this approach play in terms of the Belgium presidency?

As a simple example, we face the ludicrous situation that CPTE allows us to 
wheel power through Belgium from Fr to NL (et vv) but refuses to allow us to 
buy from or sell to Electrabel - with significant implications for the Dutch 
as well as Belgium markets, given Electrabel's strong position in both 
markets.  In that this is a cross border issue the EU ie TREN and/or COMP 
should take more interest.......but probably only if prodded by the Dutch to 
conisder it more of a priority (and pigs might fly on that one?)?

Obviously position of TREN key on this - what hot buttons can we press 
(assuming Dutch do nothing)?  Is there action that could be taken or 
threatened against Electrabel (although this would obviously need to be 
justified by lengthy and difficult abuse investigation or such like).  Is the 
reported Electrabel/Distrigas ""concert"" another angle to raise with 
TREM/COMP?  Could CPTE be fined?

Regards,

Ross

Subject: EFET Meeting with the CREG - Elect. and Gas

The meeting yesterday with the CREG was very disappointing although not 
surprising. We met Christine VANDERVEEREN - President and Department for 
dispute settlement, Thomas LEKANE - Director of the technical operation of 
the electricity market,  Jean-Paul PINON - Director of the technical 
operation of the gas market, and Fran?ois POSSEMIERS - Director of gas price 
control. The attitude of Ms VANDERVEEREN was one of resignation and apathy, 
Mr. LEKANE was very defensive (and did not seem to understand the issues i.e. 
did not understand the exchanging of energy blocks), M. PINON was the only 
one that seemed pro-active, open and wiling to listen to market participants, 
and Mr. POSSEMIERS did not say anything. 

Electricity

We presented the situation - no access to market/transit, quasi monopoly 
situation at the detriment to consumers,  no wholesale and retail market, no 
wholesale trading allowed. We insisted that in the short -term, capacity 
should be available on a UIOLI bases, block exchanges should be put in place 
ASAP. They indicated that only the strict minimum was going to be implemented 
in the short run. In particular, at the end of the meeting M. Vanderverren 
told me that the government had no intention of opening up the market for 
competition and that their only intention was to focus on internal market 
issues, and not border issues, to insure the transposition of the directive 
to fend off the Commission's latest  infringement action. 
  
The CREG is still operating under the ""we have no power"" mode. The tension 
between the CREG and the ministry is obvious and politically motivated. The 
CREG gives the impression that they are subject to the ministry's power, they 
are only acting as an administrator for the ministry in providing advice on 
proposed legislation.   The CREG continues to claim that they are not able to 
impose any rules or regulation on CPTE as CPTE is not the nominated TSO. They 
also seem to fend off any offer for us to consult on any issues other than 
draft decrees and certain ""indicative plans"" that are envisage (see below). 

Status of TSO designation:
The TSO should be nominated on 21/7. All important decrees will be passed by 
the 20/7. This includes the grid code, tariff related decrees (need 
precisions), and a new decree requiring licensing for intermediaries 
(including suppliers and traders).  Regarding this issue, the CREG is against 
additional licences but see this requirement unavoidable (due to political 
will), and asked that we provide them with comments once the proposed decree 
is available (with the condition that there will be very little time to 
provide for comments)        

Grid Code
According to a prior conversation I had with the secretary cabinet, the grid 
code should be issued by the end of June at the latest. They are still 
considering including a concentration process on specific issues. EFET will 
be scheduling a meeting with the cabinet shortly.   

Border capacity allocation:
It seems that the only change in allocation that they are considering is one 
that would implement auctions by 2002 (this what they consider to be the 
short term solution). In the long term Leanne explained that the preferred 
solution would be market splitting. They are not considering any type on 
UIOLI procedure in the immediate (despite our stressing that this should be 
easily implementable).

Trading Arrangements:
We also insisted on the need to implement ASAP block exchange procedures. It 
seemed that Lekane did not understand the issue and implied that his comments 
on  the grid code did not envisage that because of the limited time they had 
to offer comments to the ministry. (Again in previous conversation with the 
energy cabinet they are considering to include that notion and are possibly 
looking to ask for a formal consultation process)

Envisaged Consultation:
Electric: 
 Decree on licences,
 Projected demand for the next ten years - projected imports, exports and 
transits - need for production
Gas:

Title: Demand, Prices to Follow Trajectory of the Economy 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2702;


***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGY--POWER AND GAS PRICES AND VOLATILITY EXPECTED TO FALL

CERA expects a weaker US economy to be one of the outcomes of the tragic events 
on September 11, 2001, which will further reduce the demand for gas and power. 
Spot prices for natural gas and power already reflect this expectation, and 
CERA's outlook anticipates continued price weakness. 

*  As new supplies continue to arrive over the next year, even as demand 
weakens, the West will have more than adequate supplies of gas and power.
 
*  This surplus supply situation will put additional downward pressure on 
prices.

*  The shift from supply tightness to the recent plunge in prices can be traced 
principally to the rapid decline in demand for both gas and power this year, 
while supplies grew.

0,"The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces."

Stacy,
 I am trying to assess credit for a new customer, National Gas & Oil 
Cooperative. I know that there are certain restrictions for financial trading 
with COOPs, but I am unaware if any restrictions exist for physical gas. Can 
you please let me know if there is any additional information that we need to 
obtain before granting credit to this company?

hazardous waste.

Received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, 
for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred 
in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and 
assumed that the issue had been resolved. The issue in question was 
Transwestern's replacement of internal components from a smaller turbine to a 
larger turbine, with the internal components of the larger turbine components 
(inlet guide vane adjustment and removal of the regenerator) mechanically 
adjusted to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern 
received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine 
capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments operable.   Apparently, 
EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding 
as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to 
review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to 
request another hearing.  "

Subject:	Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim"

FW:? A SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY!
?
You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says ""Happy  Birthday Mijo"" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's ""Mijo's"" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say ""Mira, tan cute!""
13.??? Someone else says? ""I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, ""I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00.""
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's ""Mijo's"" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.

0,"Dear Colleague,

Earlier this month, the Edison Electric Institute published a paper I wrote 
on Bulk-Power Reliability: Potential Problems and Possible Solutions. 
Although aimed at the general reader, I hope you'll find the paper 
interesting. It is available on the Publications page of my website: 
www.EHirst.com.

The key problems I identify include:  

Declining generation reserve margins,  

Declining transmission capacity relative to load, leading to  

Increasing transmission congestion, and  

Growing number and complexity of bulk-power transactions.  

The primary solutions I discuss include:  

Federal legislation to (1) extend FERC authority over the entire bulk-power 
industry for reliability and (2) oversee a single North American reliability 
organization that sets mandatory standards;  

Large regional transmission organizations;  

Decide who decides where and when to build new transmission lines, with 
regional solutions? likely better than local ones; and?  

Expand demand-side participation in energy and ancillary-service markets.  



Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.

0,"JOhn--I just had a chance to review his testimony and I just don't think we could ask for a better (and still be believable!) statement from a consumer advocate.  I was thinking that although this is testimony before COngress, it would also be good cover for FERC.  Do you or Sarah or Christi know if FERC does or can include Congressional testimony in their analysis or can they only use formal intervention type documents?  I was just thinking that whoever interacts with FERC in the DC office could make sure that they have a copy?

Below is a link to the prepared testimony of Michael Travieso, Maryland People's Counsel, at the Barton RTO hearing last week.  His comments on the importance of a fewer number of RTOs, each with a broad geographic scope, track our own views.  As with the CFA report by Mark Cooper several months ago, these consumer groups are important to showing third party support for our efforts, particularly among Democrats in Congress.

Grant,
 The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to 
do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the 
document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the 
assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 
8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 
11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can 
discuss.

Good morning:

I have returned from an amazing ""vacation"" in Hawaii and it is good to be
home.  I played a ton of golf (thanks to my friend Pritch) and even rested
some.

I am playing in the Houston City Amateur this Friday, Saturday and Sunday at
Memorial Park.  To my Houston friends, please feel free to come out to the
park if your weekend schedule permits and you want a bit of sun and
exercise.  I'm first off tomorrw at 7:45am and Saturday, I tee off at
12:15pm.

This was one of the last places Meredith and I were together the day she
died.  My brother, Ford, is coming in from Austin to caddy for me for this
tournament as well as a qualifier for the USGA Mid-Am on Monday at
Shadowhawk.  It promises to be a special weekend for me and for us.

I continue to walk through the pain and loneliness.  Each day seems to bring
new challenges, but I press on.  I am shocked and saddened by the events on
the east coast just like everyone, but we will be a stronger and more
compassionate nation going forward.  A most unfortunate event, I know there
are so many, many families now who can partially identify with my loss.

God bless you all.  I look forward to visiting with everyone in the coming
weeks and months.

Love,

Tim

 The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are 
willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require that 
we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we 
are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction 
Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a 
response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our 
response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download 
of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hear 
from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in 
the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as 
attached.

Fred, I hope this is the information that you needed to complete January 
business.  I have already set up Track I.D. 80705 per your first request. 
Thanks, Stella

The purchase from Swift was shown at mtr 3405 during Dec and Jan.  I have 
created a new deal (#204777) to add mtr 9643 to the deal.

Deal 114096 is the purchase from HPLR Liquids.  This purchase is on 138544 
for Jan 2000 forward.

Fred is trying to set up accounting arrangments to cover the Swift deal.  Can 
you please verify that you made this purchase from Swift?  If so, is there 
another deal to replace deal #114096 of should this deal be extended into 
January.    If I should forward this to someone else, please let me know.  

Thanks for you help, Stella

Stella:

The Swift deal is not pathed correctly in POPS.  I set up an accounting 
arrangement on the 012-41500-02-015 contract with the Track ID 80705.  Would 
you put the contract in POPS with the associated Track ID?  

The transportation contract (012-41500-02-003) for the Liquids Replacement 
gas is not POPS.  I looked in Path Manager and there is no deal for it 
either.  In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend the 
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set up 
an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number 
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set 
up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so you 
can put the contract at meter 9643.

Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.

Thanks,

Fred

> Hello,

> It has been reported on CNN yesterday (Nov. 27 2000) that 60% of Americans
think Al Gore should stop his fight - now all other media outlets are
picking up this poll and running with it.
>
> WE MUST STOP THIS SPIN NOW BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE

be fought by the democrats - if you feel that they should not give up now -
please add your name to this list.

> Don't let the Republican spin and the news media win this battle. We need
to show our support for the democratic process which means that all votes
must be fairly and accurately counted.  PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO AS MANY
SUPPORTERS AS POSSIBLE!
>
> Let us remember the basic facts: Al Gore was said to have won the state of
Florida based on exit polls on election night, Al Gore is ahead in the
popular vote by almost 300,000 votes, there are 1000s of votes that sit
still never counted in the state of Florida. Al Gore is the most likely
winner of this election if all the votes are properly counted.
>
> There has been a rush to finish this process by the Bush Campaign not
because the American people are impatient but because they do not want all
the votes to be counted. Thus they are cleverly trying to declare this
desire for a quick finality to this election as the will of the people. They
have been slowly spinning this tale since the day after the election. Don't
let this spin persist. We must stop it in its tracks by making ourselves
heard!
>
> Last night - shortly after declaring victory Bush appointed Cheney the
head of the transition team. Cheney quickly asked for funds from the General
Services Administration in order to proceed with the transition. The GSA
denied this request, saying the election is still undecided. In response to
this the Bush Camp is proceeding with private funding. If this were any
other country we might even call this a coup d'etat.

Latest NFL Player News 

Redskins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Defensive end Bruce Smith, who was knocked out of Sunday's game against the Giants with a dislocated right shoulder, will miss two to three weeks while the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and range of motion. You shouldn't be using the Redskins' defense on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league to begin with. 

Keyshawn Johnson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1265&>, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01 
Johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay. He should be fine for Week Five, but see how he fares in practice before making a decision on starting him next week. 

Tiki Barber  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
The Giants said that Barber should be able to return from a hamstring injury next Sunday in St. Louis. However, it is unclear whether he will get the majority of the carries over Ron Dayne, so be careful starting either unless the Giants' RB picture clears up by then. 

Ron Dayne  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Dayne left Sunday's game against Washington with a neck stinger, an injury which the Giants said was not serious. He should be able to play next Sunday in St. Louis. 

Corey Bradford  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Bradford left Sunday's game in Tampa Bay with cramps after returning a kickoff. He will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Ryan Leaf  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12506&>, QB TB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
The Cowboys remain interest in Leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram . They may sign him to the roster and place him on injured reserve. Leaf offers no Fantasy value at this stage of his career. 

Quincy Carter  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Dont Mess Updated 10/08/01 
Carter said the next 48 hours would determine whether he will be able to play a week from Monday against Washington, according to The Dallas Morning News . He has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop during the first quarter of Sunday's game. Carter isn't a recommended Fantasy starter even when healthy. 

Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Hasselbeck (groin) missed Seattle's win over Jacksonville and watched Trent Dilfer lead the team to 24 points. Still, Mike Holmgren claimed the injured Hasselbeck will remain Seattle's starter. ""I said it before and I'll say it again,"" Holmgren told the Seattle Times . ""Matt Hasselbeck is our quarterback."" Hasselbeck's status for Seattle's next game is unclear. 

Laveranues Coles  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/08/01 
Coles sprained his ankle at Buffalo. The injury is not considered to be serious. 

Terry Glenn  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Glenn is eligible to start practicing, but the Patriots have applied for a roster exemption so he can get into playing shape. Don't expect him to be a solid contributor to the New England passing game in the near future. When he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear. 

Ray Lucas  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1418&>, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01 
Lucas appeared in short-yardage sets on Sunday. He still won't play often enough to affect Jay Fiedler's numbers. 

Kevin Kasper  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235097&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on Sunday and will miss three to six weeks. Travis McGriff or Chris Cole might see more time in the passing game while Kasper is out. 

Rickey Dudley  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1357&>, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
Dudley played with a sprained foot on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Patrick Johnson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12477&>, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury. He had already started to fall behind the emerging Travis Taylor as a preferred target in the passing game. 

Chris Weinke  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/08/01 
Weinke was extremely ineffective against the Niners Sunday. He completed only 29 of 47 passes for 275 yards. Three of his incompletions resulted in interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass. Weinke was effective in the season opener but has proven to be a Fantasy reserve at best. 

Wesley Walls  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
Walls proved to be quarterback Chris Weinke's best target Sunday against the 49ers catching 10 passes for 91 yards and a score. Walls won't do this every week but he will get a lot of looks from Weinke when he can't find his receivers. 

Terrell Owens  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1290&>, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
Owens was productive once again on Sunday, catching eight passes for 118 yards and two scores. Look for him to do well next week against Atlanta. 

Garrison Hearst  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1164&>, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01 
Hearst did not score but provided decent production Sunday against the Panthers gaining 74 yards on 18 carries. He is not starter material at this point but will be a good backup in most Fantasy leagues. 

Jeff Garcia  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=146325&>, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01 
Garcia was solid once again in Sunday's game against the Panthers. He threw for 212 yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception. 

Aaron Brooks  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=133233&>, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01 
Brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance Sunday. He only threw for 210 yards with an interception and no touchdown passes. Brooks has struggled in the last two games but the Saints will stick with him as the starter since they are winning games. 

Michael Vick  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235253&>, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01 
Vick was an adequate replacement for the injured Chris Chandler but he failed to lead the Falcons to the end zone. He completed 12 of 18 passes for 186 yards and also gained 23 yards on four carries. Look for Vick to return to the bench next week. 

Patrick Jeffers  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Jeffers (knees) missed Sunday's game against San Francisco. He continues to make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries, but isn't ready to return to action just yet. 

Kevan Barlow  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235019&>, RB SF - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that has hampered his ability since training camp. ""It happened, what, two months ago? And it probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to work through it,"" Barlow told The San Francisco Chronicle . ""People don't know how bad this is hurting."" Barlow will continue to play but the injury might prevent him from taking over as the full-time running back. Keep him on your bench for now. 

Shawn Jefferson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01 
Jefferson missed most of the second half of Sunday's game due to neck and back injuries. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Receivers Terance Mathis, Brian Finneran and Quentin McCord will be the wideouts next week if he is inactive. 

Nick Goings  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=237114&>, RB CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01 
Goings was inactive for Sunday's game as Tim Biakabutuka resumed his job as the starting running back. Keep Goings on your bench for now. 

Tim Biakabutuka  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1082&>, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01 
Biakabutuka started Sunday's game after being benched a week earlier. He wasn't too effective gaining 45 yards on 10 rushes. Biakabutuka also caught two passes for 22 yards. Keep Biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth at running back. 

Chris Chandler  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Chandler left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury was diagnosed as a Grade 1 concussion, the least severe on the scale. He is listed as day to day. Michael Vick will start next Sunday if he is unable to play. 

J.J. Stokes  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01 
Stokes sprained his knee in Sunday's game, but stayed in the contest. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Stokes had just one catch in the game for six yards. 

Laveranues Coles  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01 
Coles caught five passes for 77 yards and carried the ball two times for 15 yards at Buffalo. Coles has apparently become an important part of the New York offense in his second pro season. 

Anthony Becht  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01 
Becht caught three passes for 21 yards and a TD at Buffalo. Despite some early struggles, Becht still appears to be an key member of the New York passing game on third downs and near the goal line.

0,"You may be interested to know that on July 20, 2000 the Alberta Minister of 
Resource Development signed the new Market Surveillance Amendment Regulation 
into law.   The new regulation made four changes to the existing Market 
Surveillance Regulation, namely:

(a) it gave the MSA the new authority to monitor the conduct of the PPA 
Owners in relation to compliance with their obligations under the PPAs;
(b) it gave complaintants a mechanism to appeal a decision of the MSA not to 
further investigate a complaint to the Power Pool Council;
(c) it retained the mandatory referral mechanism by the MSA to another agency 
if the MSA's investigation determines the matter falls within another 
agency's jurisdiction (i.e. Competition Bureau) but has eliminated the 
requirement that upon such a referral the MSA cease its own investigation.   
The Power Pool Council now has the authority to determine whether the MSA 
should carry on with its investigation after a referral, or not.
(d) it added a section relating to the MSA's authority to apply to the Court 
for an order authorizing it to take evidence outside of Alberta.

Attached is a copy of the Market Surveillance Amendment Regulation.

 Journal Members:     [IMAGE] Riskless Rebound Portfolio [IMAGE]  Our Novem=
ber 2nd  edition, titled the Riskless Rebound portfolio, continues to climb=
 the charts. As of today's market close, the portfolio as a whole has now a=
ppreciated fully 36.75% over a brief two weeks. The Deutshce Bank Alex Brow=
n IPO Endwave Corporation (NASDAQ: ENWV) is leading the way, up 52% from $.=
84 to $1.28. The company came public on October 17, 2000 at $14 per share, =
and still has $1.78 per share in cash.   Readers will recall we computed th=
e portfolio would rise 88% if each of the five stocks simply appreciated to=
 the level of cash they had in the bank. Therefore, we believe there is con=
siderably more upside in this group of five stocks.   However, the NASDAQ m=
arket has rebounded dramatically off the September 21st lows, and is probab=
ly a little ahead of itself. Therefore, we would caution members who are lo=
oking for good entry levels to wait for a correction sometime between now a=
nd the end of the year before entering or adding to positions. If such a pu=
llback occurs, we will try to help you choose a good entry level.   To view=

 opportunity. If the stock drops dramatically again as the result of anothe=

results, which are as follows:   Consolidated revenues were $5.5 million, u=

 XMLG Global Technologies (OTC BB: XMLG) Turn Around in its Infancy [IMAGE]=
  [IMAGE]  The recent dramatic rise in the price of XML Global, one of our =
featured companies for 2001, has finally quieted, setting the stage for ano=
ther surge to the upside. XML Global is a leading software company developi=
ng tools for the revolutionary new XML programming language which is widely=
 viewed as the ""Holy Grail"" of ecommerce.   Despite the most challenging cl=
imate imaginable for a B to B middleware company, evidence is building that=
 XML Global's fortunes are turning back up. After making a 300% move in fiv=
e trading days, the stock has pulled back a little and quieted down, provid=
ing an excellent entry level for investors looking for powerful turn around=
 situations in the speculative end of the market.   Recent corporate develo=
pments support the notion that now is the time to accumulate this stock. Si=
nce the beginning of November the company has announced three major new con=
tracts- One with the city of Vancouver, one with the Canadian Federal Gover=
nment, and one with HomeSource Capital.    The OTC Journal believes the Hom=
eSource Capital contract to be the most important. XML is viewed by many as=
 the future of interserver communication between corporate computer systems=
. Corporate expansion has slowed to a crawl during this recession, but as s=
oon as IT spending picks up XML Global is positioned to grab a significant =
market share.   While most large corporations are embroiled in a bottoming =
business cycle, home finance companies are booming in a strong refinance ma=

 many other companies will use XML Global software as the business climate =
improves. Click Here  to read the entire text of the HomeSource contract.  =
 While there is some risk of a slight pullback in this stock as a result of=
 year end tax selling, we believe now is the time for bargain basement shop=
pers. The company is gaining the momentum we thought they would have before=
 the recession, and as business turns up there is no telling where this com=

changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

Attached is a version of AB1890.  I refer you to pages 31 through 36 which=
=20
discusses Sections 367 through 368.

Residual CTCs may have two connotations.  The first connotation is the type=
=20
of CTC recovery during the rate freeze period.  For example, the California=
=20
IOUs bill customers based on frozen rates.  From those frozen rates, delive=
ry=20
and procurement costs are subtracted.  What is left over residually is the=
=20
recovery of CTCs.  The interpretation that you are implementing is the CTCs=
=20
that are recovered after the frozen rate period.  Due to these two possible=
=20
interpretations, I believe that either the term ""residual CTCs"" needs to be=
=20
defined or a better definition of the ""Pre-Rolloff Period"" and ""Post-Rollof=
f=20
Period.""

After reading the cites that I referred to above, if you believe the=20
definition incorporates the guidelines implemented through Sections 367 and=
=20
368, then I will be comfortable with the current language.  My concern was=
=20
that the CPUC may adopt changes to the recovery plan per Section 368 that=
=20
would disadvantage ESPs and DA customers, and only benefit and protect=20
Standard Offer customers.  Pursuant to Section 368, the IOUs implemented co=
st=20
recovery plans to recover costs that meet the criteria in Section 367.  I a=
m=20
worried that customers may be confused by plans that may be implemented in =
a=20
the Post-Rolloff periods that may look like the original cost recovery plan=
s=20
(i.e. SDG&E's rate cap).

You can contact Susan Mara, Jeff Dasovich, or Mona Petrochko in Government=

Thanks for forwarding me the contract.  In Section 3(a), there is a=20
definition for ""Post-Rolloff Period"" which states, ""shall mean, with respec=

I like this deal structure because it provides a hedge for our current book=
=20
in California.  Correct me if I am wrong, but if the end of the transition=
=20
period ends earlier than priced, then our mark for this deal should increas=
e=20
because we are providing the discount off the frozen bundled price for a=20
shorter period than expected.  Conversely, if the rate freeze ends later th=
an=20
how we priced it, then the mark for this deal will decrease because we will=
=20
have provided a discount off of the frozen tariff for a period longer than =
we=20
had priced.  This impact on the mark is converse to the current risk profil=
e=20
of our California portfolio.

My main concern is the contract language on how the transition period is=20
defined.  It is important that this language is crafted to leave no loose=
=20
ends.  Can you please send me a copy of the clauses that define the end of=
=20
the transition period, which is a critical date because the delivery risks=

hinge on that definition.  I just want to do some preventative maintenance,=

such that we do not enter contract dispute over this issue in the future. =

However, we may proceed signing this contract if necessary.  I would just=

like to follow up on the issue for future deals if it is too late for this=

deal.  As a matter of fact, I would not even try to change the contract=20
language on this deal because the customer may become overly concern.

I recommend that Scott signs the DASH for Gart Sports for now.

billion. I left DDI at the end of 1995 and became a professor and Keio
University Business School for 4 years. I have also been an active member in
the government telecom deregulation committee. I left Keio University last
year and founded eAccess in November 1999. With less than one year in

Subject: Buy/Resells - What We Learned

John,

From our research into Avista and others, here is what we have learned about 
using Buy/Resells:

Whether to select ""Buy From"" or ""Sell To"" upon deal entry is determined by 
the ultimate purpose of the BR, as shown here:

Purpose:  
Pay the Customer (sleeve or other service they have provided to EPMI)

Type is Buy From
Pricing is:  Buy = EPMI price
      Sell = Customer price

Charge the Customer (services or other, like transmission recapture)

Type is Sell To
Pricing is:  Buy = Customer price
      Sell = EPMI price

I hope this helps to determine the correct way of entering a buy/resell, and 
will alleviate settlement discrepancies in the future.  If you agree with 
this, feel free to share it with the real time group.  

Caroline

Julie,

Deal 640685 for March 01 production:  per Daren Farmer (in the Audit field in Sitara), this was copied from deal #547201.  This deal is the Crude Swap where volume stayed but price got zeroed out and booked as a demand charge under 679847 and 679848.

Please confirm that it is the Crude Swap and rebook as necessary.

If you have any questions or need additional clarification, please let me or Katherine H. know.

Thanks in advance for your help on this matter.

Subject:	GLO/EGM Gas/Crude Swap

George - I've done some T-accounts (the bean counter in me) and I think the following is the best way to handle this going forward:
	
Change the existing deals, 547201 and 591307, to a zero price.  This will eliminate the A/R balance on HPL's books for GLO, but will keep the volume nom'd to GLO and will not impact UA4.
Enter a ticket on HPL for a sale to ENA for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets.  This should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $974,144 for 1/01 and $766,304 for 2/01.
Enter a ticket on ENA where the ENA-Wellhead Book purchases the demand from HPL.  The amounts would be the same as in #2 above.
Enter a ticket on ENA where the ENA-Wellhead Book sells demand to EGM for the value of the crude oil for the prior month.  For 1/01, the sale would be for $886,638.60 (the 12/00 Crude Oil delivered to EGM by GLO).  For 2/01, the sale would be for $839,008.29 (the 1/01 Crude Oil delivered to EGM by GLO).

This will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward:
The price on the sale from HPL to GLO will need to be zeroed out monthly.
The demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out.
The demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to EGM.

Once this is done, the A/R balance for GLO will be cleared, the margin will be on the ENA Wellhead book, and the intercompany transactions will move the money from EGM to HPL.  This needs to be done monthly prior to flash, which will prevent any OA variances.  The index for the gas value is available shortly after the 1st of the month, and since the volume is firm, there shouldn't be a problem calculating the value.  We should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ENA to EGM.  If you have any questions or see a better way to do this, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: The CODE



The CODE (rules for men): 

1. Thou shall not rent 'Chocolat'. 

2. Under no circumstances may 2 men share an umbrella. 

3. Any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and
eaten by his fellow partygoers. 

4. When you are queried by a buddy's wife, girlfriend, mother, father,
priest, shrink, dentist, accountant, or dog walker, you need not and should
not provide any useful information whatsoever as to his whereabouts. You are

permitted to deny his very existence. 
 
5. Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a
friend out of jail within 12 hours. 

6. You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent without
recrimination; beyond that, anyone within 
earshot is allowed to call bullshit. (Exception:  When trying to pick up a
girl, the allowable exaggeration rate rises to 400 percent) 

7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off-limits
forever. 

8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for another guy who's running
late is 5 minutes. For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every
point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale. 

9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's refrigerator is
forbidden. You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable. 

10. No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another man. (In
fact, even remembering a friend's birthday is strictly optional.) 

11. Agreeing to distract the ugly friend of a hot babe your buddy is trying
to hook up with is your legal duty.  Should you get carried away with your
good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is forbidden to
speak of it, even at your bachelor party. 

12. Before dating a buddy's ex, you are required to ask his permission; and
he, in return, is required to grant it. 

13. Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated as spies
until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a
buffalo wing clean. 

14. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem  - you didn't see nothin'.


15. The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer. 

16. A man must never own a cat or like his girlfriend's cat.  

17. You girlfriend must bond with your buddy's girlfriends within 30 minutes
of meeting them. You are not required to make nice with her gal pals'
significant dick-heads --- low-level sports bonding is all the law requires.


18. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sports event, you may always
ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing. 

19. When your girlfriend / wife expresses a desire to fix her whiney friend
with your pal, you may give her the go-ahead only if you'll be able to warn
your buddy and give him time prepare excuses about joining the priesthood. 

20. (Gas Warfare Act) you may flatuate in front of a woman only after you've
brought her to climax. But, if you trap her head under the covers for the
purpose of flatuent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend. 

21. It is permissible to consume a fruity chick drink only when you're
sunning on a tropical beach...And it's delivered by a topless
supermodel...and it's free. 

22. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked. 
 
23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain
sober enough to fight. 
 
24. If a buddy is outnumbered, outmanned, or too drunk to fight, you must
jump into the fight. Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions have
caused you to think, ""What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin,"" you may
sit back and enjoy. 

25. Friends don't let friends wear Speedo's. Ever.  Issue closed. 

26. Phrases that may NOT be uttered to another man while weight lifting:
""Yeah, baby, push it!"" ""C'mon, give me one more! Harder!""  ""Another set and
we can hit the showers."" ""Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?"" 

27. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza,
but not both.  That's just plain mean. 

28. If you compliment a guy on his six-pack, you better be referring to his
beer. 

29. Never join your girlfriend / wife in dissings a buddy, except when she's
withholding sex pending your response. 

30. Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal footing: Both
urinating or both waiting in line. In all other situations, a nod is all the
conversation you need. 
 
31. If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, you may not
join him  ...too gay. 

32. Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt
one intervention. If he is able to get on his feet, look you in the eye, and
deliver a ""F@CK OFF!"" You are absolved of your of responsibility. 

33. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly ""just a friend"" have
carnal, drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is
no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big
mistake it was. 

34. In Black Jack, always split aces and eight's.  No arguments.

I got your contact details from the  web site for power marketers. I have a

energy company like?Enron, where my  abilities and qualifications can be 
fully applied for our mutual benefit.  

I am graduating in May with an  MBA?degree with concentrations in finance and 
information systems. This  summer I worked?as an intern with Structuring and 
Analytics group of Ameren  Energy.?This internship?has been especially  
challenging and has enhanced my professional competencies. While there, I  
was afforded the opportunity to?develop a forward view  model?for?off-
peak?electricity price forecasting and analyze the  data sets of a 
fundamental?model to create forward price curves. Both  projects added value 
to the company and provided me with first-hand experience  in the area of 
energy trading and marketing as well as modeling  techniques.

0,"PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:




As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

0,"ambiguity (am-bi-GYOO-i-tee) noun

   1. Doubtfulness or uncertainty as regards interpretation.

   2. Something of doubtful meaning.

[From Latin ambiguus, uncertain, from ambigere, to go about : ambi-, around +
agere, to drive.]

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/ambiguity.gif

AMBIGUITY
        Ambiguity is one of a handful of English words whose meaning
describes itself. In other words, ""Ambiguity"" is ambiguous. It refers, on
the one hand, to a situation of imprecision, of obscurity, because more
than one interpretation is possible. On the other hand, something ambiguous
can be understood perfectly well - but from more than one point of view.
        We are amused at the fable of the elephant and the six blind men,
each of whom understood the elephant to be a very different animal. But we
seem to lose that good-natured perspective just in time to assume that our
own point of view on the world is more accurate than that of many of the
other human beings on the planet. We avoid ambiguity as much as possible,
feeling threatened that it may expose our own point of view as merely an
option.
        But we should embrace ambiguity. After all, each of our eyes sees a
slightly different, two-dimensional, view of reality. Those two images are
synthesized by the brain into a single three-dimensional image, which we
think of as ""more real"" than a 2-D view. The more points of view we are able
to see, the more clearly we understand the world around us. Reality is
ambiguous. Ambiguity is synthesis.
        I like to think that looking at everything - not only words -
from alternate points of view, can enhance our understanding of the world
around us.

AMBIGRAMS
Ambigrams are words that can be read from more than one point of view.
I have been creating ambigrams as visual meditations on language--as
commercial graphics and as fine art pieces--for almost thirty years.
Anu has invited me to share my unique point of view on language with
his A.Word.A.Day audience. I certainly appreciate this opportunity. I
hope you will enjoy looking at words in this new way and find it both
entertaining and thought-provoking.

Each day this week, your AWAD regular mail will consist of an ambigram, a
paragraph or so about a particular word, exploring some unorthodox points
of view regarding its meaning.  As it really makes more sense to view the
ambigram first, and in a format that allows you to invert it, I suggest
that you print it out, so you can enjoy its symmetry and reversibility
before and while you read.          -John Langdon (langdojw@drexel.edu)

(This week's Guest Wordsmith, John Langdon, teaches in the College of
Design Arts at Drexel University in Philadelphia. For more information

Subject: Actions on Anjam's resignation

All

My preferred approach to dealing with Anjam's departure is given below.  
These recommendations are informed by the fact that I don't feel Anjam has 
much to offer his next employer, except what code and data he can remove from 
Enron:

HR-type stuff:
1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for 
him to remain on the floor.
2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know 
our positions and curves next.

IT-type stuff:
1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the 
group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more 
than a day or two.
2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals 
over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has 
deleted.
3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records 
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried 
about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out.
4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from 
Anjam's c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.

Subject: Future GE forecast - John Schroeder

Need input if anyone thinks we need more turbines than John Schroeder/GE has 
forecasted.  My gut feel is that John has forecasted more turbines than we 
will need (which is OK).  

The GE planning Boys called John and asked him to check with Enron....... and 
determine if Enron wanted any turbines in the 2002/2003 timeframe (the 
previous assumption being 7F's wouldn't be available till 4Q03, and 7EA's 
wouldn't be available till 1Q03).  John stated that he didn't know what the 
request from Schenectady meant....., but....., maybe a few production slots 
were coming available as things shake out.....  John told them that he 
thought Enron might be interested in:

qty 4 7EA's and qty 4 7F's for ESA
qty 2 7EA's and qty 2 7F's for Mexico
qty 6 7EA's and qty 6 7F's for NA

John is asking us........, ""that would be enough...... right?"".  We don't 
need to change that input (from John Schroeder to Schenectady) if we want 
less than he forecasted, but....., if someone knows something I don't, 
and....., we would want more turbines than the above......., please let us 
know.  

On an immediate basis, John also stated that he had requests in for turbines 
for Saudi, and....., ""an island project"".

Gentlemen:
I good friend at Sun suggested me to contact  all of you at Enron  in
regard to the direction of my current searching campaign as  I have made
the decision to leave my post as Vice President and General Manager of
Network Associates Latin America and Caribbean. It is of my understanding
that Enron is undergoing a huge  internal transformation to become one of
the leading E-Commerce players worldwide.

Network Associates is the leading and independent provider   of total
security software solutions to monitor and protect telecommunications,
E-Commerce and internet applications worldwide. Since I was given the
mission to start  the region in 1996 I have been instrumental to
increase sales from 2M to 35M US in 4 years. I have been in charge of
supervising and managing over 100 employees across the region and the US
with complete P&L responsibilities.

Previous to join NAI, I worked  for Seagate where I had the
responsibilitity to set up the whole  supply chain in South Florida and
and across the region resulting in a sales increase from 25M to 125M US
in 4 years. With over 20 years of experience selling and transfering
technology internationally I feel proud of my record and accomplishments.


Should any of you be interested in talking to me about any opportunity
within any of your organizations, please do not hesitate to call me at
954-452-0664. Thank you in advance for your positive consideration. Best
regards, Herbert Arturo Molina

0,"Rick,
I know you are just getting back in - I don't think anything requires your immediate attention - although I could use some help on the important but not burning issues like budgets, personell, trends in the business, what's up with Enron, initiatives that you think we should be undertaking.....

Just to give you a sense
Profit wise this has not shaped up to be a good quarter - we will be scrambling for some pretty big numbers in order to make the quarter - likely candidates are:
a look at the major curves (price and volatility) in UK power
deals with the major offtakers of TPL - British Energy, London Electricity....
a couple of portfolio deals in enroncredit
a significant alumina/aluminum swap with China National Container - I believe we have boxed the credit risk reasonably well.
what else?? I'll keep you posted.

Continue to see a ramp up in activity and requirements for coal and global products
I have talked to the new origination team working for Randy Maffet here and they are looking at some big and complex deals a al GAF
Haven't heard anything on project Nero (public EIM deal)  since I left you that message.
Lots of activity on the Continent particulary with EdF auctioning capacity
New deal in EBS - $4.3MM dollars in capacity payments - bad credit NEOS
EWZ joint venture looks likely to be signed.


The inflow of humans is starting - 2 new people monday, 2 more on the 17th, couple more before month end.
Sr. Director for Metals/Global mkts starts 10-15
have verbal offer acceptance from Sr. Director/Credit with focus on UK just recieved - probably a nov start.

We had an all-RAC EEL meeting with Michael Brown which seems well recieved.
Also did an initial cut of a 'risk review' of Enron Credit with Michael that went well.  Plan to do with you next week.

This month's Risk Magazine features 3 RAC employees - Daid Port and Rudi Zipter in an article about risk visualization and Christine Stanchus in an article regarding collateral managment.

let me know if there is anything you need from me or anything I should be thinking about.

Ted

ps  I'd pay admission to your meetings later this week."
0,"I've got Bilas's ""winter of discontent.""  What a buffoon.  It takes more guts 
than a train robber to, on one hand, propose a spineless, ineffective 
approach to dealing with what are now recognized as serious flaws in the 
current regulatory structure, and in the same breath, go to the court of 
public opinion and whine about a gas market spinning madly out of control.  
Apparently, he's also setting the table for possible intervention in the 
market by state lawmakers or regulators if we get any more ""out of whack.""

Are you going over to see Bilas today with Mike Day, et al.?  Are we to 
assume by Bilas's wishy-washy statements to the media that the Comprehensive 
Settlement is still on the table?  Thoughts, please.


Natural Gas Intelligence, Wednesday, December 6, 2000
CA Officials See Potential Gas Supply Problems
Some state officials already are dubbing the upcoming heating season as 
California's ""winter of discontent"" as continued high wholesale natural gas 
prices are driving up consumer bills and state regulators look at options for 
unbundling Southern California Gas Co.'s transmission and storage system. 
According to other state energy officials he talks with, Richard Bilas, 
commissioner at the California Public Utilities Commission, said, ""We could 
have some real problems."" Bilas, the former energy commissioner and 
immediate-past president of the CPUC, has proposed a modest unbundling of 
SoCalGas' system, given the current energy price volatility, in a proposed 
settlement decision now being reviewed. Action on the proposed decision could 
come Dec. 21, but observers predict alternate orders will be offered by some 
of Bilas's colleagues on the five-member CPUC, and that could push into next 
year final action. 
If gas prices continue at their precedent-setting levels, California likely 
will be intervening at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as it already 
has been doing regarding last summer's electricity price spikes, Bilas said. 
""There are a lot of things the state can do, but whether they are done is a 
matter of philosophical and political judgment,"" he said. ""If gas prices get 
totally out whack in the view of a number of state decision-makers, there is 
likely to be intervention on behalf of the state into gas pricing. And I 
don't know if any of that serves the public well in the long run, but this is 
a short-run political problem."" 
As for his proposed decision on settlement for the unbundling of the 
SoCalGas's system, Bilas is unsure at this point if it will stimulate a more 
robust core aggregation market --- now almost a decade old --- with added 
volumes and marketers. He said he needs to hear from participants in the 
market in response to the proposed decision, which basically adopts the more 
modest compromise of three different settlements filed with the CPUC. 
""I'll know better where this proposed decision is going in another two weeks 
after I have talked with the other commissioners and some of the parties,"" 
said Bilas, noting that the pending gas settlements should be the last major 
changes in California's gas market for awhile, unless the state legislature 
decides to get involved as it has on several occasions in the past three 
years. 
""Everything to do with gas matters statewide is on the table and I am not 
going to make any predictions,"" Bilas said during a telephone interview in 
which he expressed concerns about both natural gas and electricity issues in 
California in the coming year. He said the supply-demand imbalance for the 
state's electricity market needs long-term solutions, but he thinks 
short-term political answers will win out. 
Bilas said the recent state energy commission conclusion that California's 
electricity needs can be met with the existing plants underway or proposed 
could pan out, but only if an unlikely combination of three factors converge: 
all the plants now on the drawing board actually get built, no major electric 
or gas transmission bottlenecks occur, and energy prices stabilize. 
""Even if all of the proposed plants came on line in two years rather than 
three, I think we still would have problems,"" he said. ""Let's face it, demand 
for electricity in the Pacific Northwest and California is growing like 
crazy. So, until there is something done on the demand side, so we get some 
demand responsiveness, just attacking the supply side I don't think is going 
to do it."" "

At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following:

?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. ""Professional Services"" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/.  

?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall.  

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S.

?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensible actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendations."

0,"Larry - I've received a copy of the compliance order.  It assesses a penalty 
of $15,000 per day for each day of violation (May 1996 to September 8, 1997 
or  496 days).  This results in a fine of $7.44 million.  I hope the order 
has a typo and the NMED meant a penalty of ""up to"" $15,000 per day of 
violation. If this is not a typo I see no downside to asking for a hearing 
and a settlement conference. We may do so anyway.  Since we only have till 
mid-July to file the request for hearing which must include very specific 
admissions or denials and the basis of our affirmative defenses, I'd like 
Larry to flesh out the notes below and pull any relevant documentation 
together.....

Dave - let's discuss counsel for this matter in the morning and I'd like to 
make a call to NMED counsel.  I'd be tempted to bring Braddock in even though 
this is New Mexico...

Subject: Compliance Order, P-1 C/S

Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air 
Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 
C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this 
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further 
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was 
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of 
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing 
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide 
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to 
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received 
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, 
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher 
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not 
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by 
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is 
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern 
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this 
turbine at their descretion.

In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a 
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than 
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be 
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple 
cycle.   

  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to 
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the 
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern 
has 30 days to request another hearing. 

Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and 
handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
conference call for sometime next week? "

Subject:	RE: TW Salt Dome Storage

At our meeting Thurs 7/19 with SouthWest Gas, Tom Armstrong informed us that SWG is the property and mineral rights holder for this salt dome north of the TW line near Kingman.  SWG is completing a feasibility and engineering analysis on developing the potential gas storage site.  I indicated that TW / Enron would welcome an opportunity to work with SWG in developing the storage field and Tom was very receptive to the idea.

SWG refers to the project as their Pataya or Red Lake storage field.  The project would be 12 bcf net of pad gas, turn 12x per year, with 300mm/d deliverability.  Phase I of 6 bcf may be operational by late 2003.  Tom and I agreed to stay in touch on the project.  SWG hopes to have a decision to move forward by year end 2001.

Subject:	Salt Domes

Kevin, I can't remember who was asking (or if it was even Marketing asking the question) but, a couple of weeks ago someone wanted to know if we knew of any salt domes or potential storage fields in the Needles area.   Well I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks and once I got to checking there are some salt domes in the Kingman area.  They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.  Anyhow, just thought we would pass this along and if this is something of interest or if you need more information let us know....  Oh yea, Transwesterns pipeline is just South of Kingman, Az.  (approximately 10 to 12 miles from the domes.)

Now that we are bobbing up for air from Red Rock, I wanted to investigate this a little further.  I have not found anyone from Marketing who recalls looking at a potential salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  Are you familiar with anything that may be happening on this?

Kim,

At one time there was someone in marketing looking at developing salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  I was wondering what if any was the status of that evaluation.  Given the increasing number of power plants being installed in the area, this has the potential to reduce expansion costs where we have highly variable loads.

Two things:

1.  Send these sentence to the Cal Px:

""Enron thinks that the elimination of physical risk during the month of 
August will be of commercial benefit because Enron expects that during the 
month of August there will be transmission line derations affecting the hour 
ahead market which will lead to TO debit charges by the CAISO.   The 
elimination of  TO debit charges is a commercial benefit to Enron. ""

I will call them and discuss this with them when I get back on next Tuesday.

2.  Do not do any financial BF trades in September.  Let's sort it back 
through with them.  The letter is surprising and we need to figure out why 
they sent it.  One month of financial at 50% is ok, but lets not do any more 
till we talk to them. ----cgy"
0,"Kim,
I uploaded the files using the SQL uploader program and found no problems 
with the upload process.

However, I am confused about the sample data's origin. Are they from Monfort 
or Klondike? Or are these just test data?
When I open the files the system numbers indicate that they were from the 
Monfort site.

If the files were tested from Klondike, the system number should be 840008001 
(008 is the site number for Klondike). 
I am hoping the download program does not change the system number to 001 for 
a site.

Thank you
-John

Subject: Re: Autodownload tool  

Kim,

This looks pretty good, and will certainly be helpful to the people at the 
site trying to do the downloads. Just a couple of points:

(1) From this I don't understand how metmasts are to be configured. So maybe 
some clarification of that would be good. (Is it Met[met#] (WTG#) ?)

(2) For the Monyymm.db files, we need to get both the current month and the 
previous month (at least for the 1st week of the month), I can't tell if this 
software is doing that.

This looks like this should provide a big help in downloading data. Do you 
have a sample that you can send so we can compare to what our oracle upload 
script is expecting? (Just to be sure.)

Hope my comments are helpful.

Mark

hi Mark,

The files-download tool is finished, but before we deploy it to the field,  
can  you please review the Auto-download Program Version 1 spec and let me 
know if it follows the requirements?   Also, I am modifying the code for 
version 2. Thus, it is very important that I hear from you.  Thank you much!

Subject: Re: Autodownload tool  

Kim,

First, Hollis will be out of the office until further notice.  I'll be 
coordinating his tasks for the time being.  Since I don't have the full back 
ground on this development here are my thoughts.

I agree we should work towards the best solution for the task.  It may be 
that the version you are testing is that solution.  The immediate problem we 
are trying to solve is;

1) the sites spend too much time downloading these files
2) we need data consistently and frequently here in Tehachapi, system 
performance team,
3) the sooner we have a solution the more time we will save.

A quick review of the REC document indicates some type of download cycle in 
addition to file format, which would be useful for other reasons.  The on 
site servers are not set up to store real-time data currently, nor is the SQL 
transfer program currently designed to accommodate all of the various files 
listed in either solution.

Last thing, would it be possible for you to send me test data so we can test 
out upload to our STAR db.  There shouldn't be an issue, but this would 
complete a 360 test.

Hi Hollis,

It seems that REC- SCADA is working on the same task as I am, though the 
actual coding has yet begun.  I have coded and now testing at Klondike a 
simplified version of this task (spec. attached).    But before I start to 
modify the code for version 2, perhaps we and REC project leader of this tool 
should come together to derive an optimal decision for this task. What are 
your thoughts?

 When you brought me the resumes last week, you indicated that you had 
screened certain of the applicants and that Janette had certain ideals 
concerning the group.  I have had the resumes reviewed by Harry Collins, 
Carlos Sole, and myself and would like your opinion regarding the following 
applicants:

 Vanessa G. Griffin She is the current temp that is filling in for this 
position.
 Mary G. Martinez Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
 Esmeralda Gonzales I believe that Mary Cook has talked to her on more than 
one occasion.
 Sheryle E. Malek
 M. Denise Keauquier
 Maggie Valles
 Mary Lou Browder Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
Additionally, Travis McCullough has been lobbying for us to talk to the temp 
that is currently filling the position for which he has hired his old 
secretary.

 If the foregoing list is okay, we would like to start the interview process 
Wednesday afternoon.  I have suggested to Harry and Carlos, that we jointly 
interview each applicant.  If this is acceptable, I will obtain access to a 
conference room for this purpose.

 Please let me know if there are any problems relating to anyone on the above 
list."

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Wednesday, June 6.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
A day after upbeat profit forecasts lifted stocks, a couple
of earnings warnings knocked them back down. J.P. Morgan
Chase and Hewlett-Packard -- two members of the Dow Jones
industrials -- both projected difficult business conditions
in the quarters ahead.

J.P Morgan Chase fell 3.4 percent after warning of lower
trading revenue, and H-P shares dipped 4.5 percent after
the company said the global technology slowdown could
persist for some time. Other financial and computer stocks
fell in sympathy.

Their losses helped drag the Dow down 106, or 0.9 percent,
to 11,070. More broadly, the Nasdaq Composite fell 16 to
2,218 and the Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 14 to 1,270.

Energy stocks lost ground thanks to news that U.S.
inventories of crude oil and gasoline rose sharply in the
latest week. The weekly update from the American Petroleum
Institute showed a 3.4-million-barrel increase in crude
stocks and led prices of both gas and oil lower.

Exxon-Mobil shares fell 2.3 percent to 89.40, accounting
for about 13 Dow index points. Oil drillers, natural-gas
producers and refiners all saw their share prices decline.

Fewer than a third of S&P industry groups posted gains
Wednesday, and those that rose generally advanced 2 percent
or less. Health care companies, defense stocks,
consumer-products makers and electronics retailers did best.

Subject: Recruiting at CMU Computational Finance Program



Vince,

Greetings!  I am the director of the MS in Computational Finance program at
Carnegie Mellon.  I am following up on a conversation I had with Kevin
Kindall, a graduate of our program, who gave me your e-mail address and
suggested I contact you as the individual making the recruiting decisions
for the Research Group at Enron.

In speaking with the director of the Career Opportunity Center at the
business school, I am told that although an Alison Bailey from Enron
(mary.alison.bailey@enron.com) has arranged for a sizable block of rooms in
which to conduct interviews on campus on December 11th, there is as yet no
indication of whether the Comp Finance students will have opportunity to
compete for these spaces.

We are regarded by many in the industry as the top quantitative finance
program in the country.  Focused on derivative pricing, econometrics, VAR
and portfolio management, our graduates should be an excellent fit for your
business.  I would be happy to talk with you further about our
rogram( http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/) as well as our students' interest
in Enron (the name comes up a lot!).  Also, if you are interested, we run a
""Speaker Series""  on most Friday's during the fall and spring that would
give you (or another in your group) the opportunity to address our students
in an area of interest.  Such a meeting would, I think, help you better
understand the careers our students are preparing to pursue as well as give
our students first hand knowledge of Enron and its future.

When might be a good time to contact you by telephone?

Thank you for your time.

Rick

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.

Subject: Proposed Enron/Petron ISDA documentation

Hi Sara,

How are things with you, m'dear?  Have you any exotic destinations planned 
for this year's vacation?

Anyway - I'm planning to go on vacation with my family (yah - it's weird to 
say ""family"" now!)  to Perth from Thursday 23 September through to Saturday 3 
October and was wondering whether you could help 'babysit' the Petron 
matter.  Janice had mentioned that you'd done some due diligence on ISDA in 
the Philippines a year or so ago so I thought that you would probably be the 
most appropriate person to look after this matter in my absence.  Matt, who 
is a new attorney who joined us in the Singapore office last week, will also 
be keeping track of this file but he hasn't been fully 'Enronized' by Tana as 
yet (tho' he will be so before Thanksgiving as he'll be headed to Houston 
next month for a month's stint there) so I thought it best if you could be 
the main contact person for Petron as well as for our business folks during 
that week that I'm not around.  I really hope that you don't mind.

Assuming that you're OK with this, I would like to give your name and contact 
details to the Enron AP/A/CHI biz folks who are handling this - Manuel 
Gallego in the Philippines, Victor Santos who is presently relocating to 
Singapore and David Terlip to whom they report.  The traders in the Singapore 
office, John Chismar and Eng Wang Moi , will be providing the pricing.  Matt 
and my assistant, Angeline, will get hold of you should they hear from Petron 
during that week.  The plan is that Petron is interested in entering into 
some crack spread swaps with us.  So far, Citibank and Chase have signed up 
ISDAs with Petron.

In the meantime, I'll have Angeline fax to you copies of all the 
correspondence which I've had had with our Filipino counsel QTE to-date so 
that you'll get a good idea of what the regulatory and legal environment's 
like now in the Philippines. [Angeline - can you please do that today.  
Sara's fax no. is Houston Legal's fax no.]

So far, QTE has reviewed our draft ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex and 
I sent it across to Petron's inhouse counsel on 8 September (please see 
attached) and I'm now waiting for their written comments on those drafts.  

Please let me know whether you'll be able to look after this matter for me.  
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks a mill,
Anita

Dear Luis,

I am the Senior Legal Counsel for Enron  based in Singapore and have been 
requested by my colleague, Manuel Gallego, to forward to you our proposed 
draft ISDA documentation for your review.  The attached documents are as 
follows:

our draft ISDA schedule (draft dated 7 September 1999) attached as 
petron-isda (7Sept99).doc
our draft ISDA Credit Support Annex (draft dated 6 September 1999) attached 
as petron-cs (6Sept99).doc
our form of legal opinion to be issued by your external legal counsel (draft 
dated 6 September 1999) attached as petron-isda (ext opn) (6Sept99).doc

Please note that the attached documents are in draft and are for discussion 
only and are as such open to any further changes which may be proposed by 
ourselves or our external legal counsel.

I would be most grateful if you could review the attached and thereafter let 
me have your written response to the same.  You may either e-mail your

ENA signed two originals of the Letter Agreement (as the Letter Agreement
has only two parties).  I kept one for ENA and provided the other to Greg
Lang for PPL by letter dated May 2, 2001.  I still do not have an original
of PPL's signature, but Greg Lang did provide a fax copy.    Is it necessary
for the parties to sign additional copies for non-parties?   I am checking

0,"That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and 
we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you 
double check with Bob for accuracy.

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

To   : Mr. Kenneth L. Lay (klay@enron.com)
       Chairman & CEO,
       Enron Corp.

Dear Mr. Lay,

Further to my emails dated 22/2/2000 & 14/6/2000 introducing Tata Housing a=
s
a premium real estate developer in India, and specifically, our commercial
complex Technopolis KnowledgePark at Andheri (E), Mumbai.  We have been
given to understand  that Enron have acquired an additional space in  Kamla
Mills Compound.  We were surprised to note that Enron did not consider
Technopolis KnowledgePark inspite of it being a ready to move in building
with all the facilities required for a good Call Center.

A few of these facilities being -

_ High speed (100 MBPS)  data network with switched interconnection
      between offices.
_ Provision  for  ISDN lines.
_ 5000 line MTNL  exchange on campus
_ Power from Tata Electric Cos, which is 20% cheaper than the Government
      supply.
_ In addition,  a good quality restaurant and 24 hours ATM facility.
_ Central Air-conditioning & Building Automation System.

All these facilities and more were explained to Mr. Edward de Valcourt,
Project Director Communications, Enron Corp., when he visited Technopolis
KnowledgePark on 16/6/2000.  Inspite of that, we have once again not been
considered.  I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that we
currently have approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. of space available at
Technopolis KnowledgePark.  We are also in the process of constructing the
IInd Phase in the same complex which is approximately 60,000 sq.ft. and can
be made entirely available to you, if required.

Further, we have another building of approximately 1,00,000 sq.ft. located
strategically at Kanjurmarg.  This too could be ideal for your requirement.
We would also like to inform you that Tata Housing has a large land bank an=
d
can offer properties to Enron for Call Centres  across the country.
We request you to once again look into the same and revert to us at the
earliest.

Thanking you
Yours sincerely,
TATA HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CO. LTD.

Enron's secret bid to save deregulation/PRIVATE MEETING: Chairman pitches his 
plan to prominent Californians
Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers


   Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly
courted Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other
luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution
to California's energy crisis.
   His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and
federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.
   Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign
contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at
the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.
   Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham
Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in
1990 and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star
Schwarzenegger;
   and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have
been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.
   One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be
identified, said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting
participants to support Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who
are trying to solve the state's energy mess.
   PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION
   The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is
concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with
power markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government
authority to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last
week to create and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and
run power plants in California.
   ""They're trying to rescue deregulation,"" the source said of Enron
executives. ""They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea.""
   At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position
paper titled ""Comprehensive Solution for California,"" which was obtained
by The Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the
billions in debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that
investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are
making matters worse.
   The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway
electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power
generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by
regulators and economists.
   One of the talking points read: ""Get deregulation right this time --
California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers.""
Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving
electricity.
   INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS
   Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and
was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment
with a competitive power market system.
   Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially
produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from
generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this
year, Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.
   Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for
Enron, said she would ""look into that"" and then did not return repeated
telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at
the meeting.
   D.C. CONNECTIONS
   Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached
unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times,
Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs
regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story
also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not
support Lay's desire to further deregulate the nation's electricity
system. Lay denied the allegation.
   Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief
executive of home builder Kaufman & Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of
Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant
Amgen.
   Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles
Lakers star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton
supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's
first civilian space trip.
   Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but
declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for
comment through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday
afternoon.
   A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor
attended,
   but was ""not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this
issue.
   His intent is to listen to all sides.""
   Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to
Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support
Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source
who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal
and asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his
agenda.

As a courtesy follow-up to that meeting, I wanted to tell you about him and 
the skills I think he possesses.  LaRence spent 2000 working for 3 different 
bosses in EBS, and when the music stopped with me at the helm, he had not 
produced enough identifiable work product for any one of us to be able to 
fall on our sword for him.  The double whammy was that he was at the point of 
aging out of the Associate program and in need of a commercial position.  In 
my opinion, LaRence was not suited to the type of work I need my people to do 
in EBS Structuring, and I had to pass on a promotion for him.  His ranking 
stems from the fact that he couldn't keep up with the other Associates in the 
group with respect to hard-core models and business analysis.  We eventually 
put him in the role of implementation, where his main objectives have been to 
identify and overcome barriers to getting a deal up and running, which 
everyone agrees is his strength.  He has good internal networking skills, is 
a hard worker, knows Enron, and communicates the essentials to management.  
If that's what your team needs, he may be a fit.  Hopefully this goes without 
saying, but please don't think of this as a ""no-look pass.""  LaRence needs to 
find a home on his own merits.  I just promised him that I would tell people 
the background details of his situation when appropriate.

Thanks for talking to him and please call me if you have questions,
Brad Richter

Calif Sen Pwr Probe Committee OKs Deposing Energy Execs ?????
Updated: Friday, July 20, 2001 08:16 AM?ET ?????

(This article was originally published Thursday) 

By Jason Leopold 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--A California Senate committee investigating 
manipulation in the state's wholesale power market approved a measure late 
Thursday, authorizing the committee to depose the chief executives of major 
energy companies to provide insight into the companies' trading practices. 

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted 28-6 in 
favor of deposing some of the energy sector's most powerful chief executives. 


The move comes a day after the committee held Reliant Energy Inc. (REI, news, 
msgs) and Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) in contempt for refusing to provide 
documents on its electricity trading and sales practices. The full Senate is 
expected to vote on the contempt charge and decide the punishment to impose. 

Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee chair, would have carte blanche to 
depose executives, such as Enron Chairman Ken Lay, who has been singled out 
by Attorney General Bill Lockyer for gouging consumers in the state. 

Representatives of the energy companies under investigation were not 
available for comment. 

The committee has been investigating whether energy companies knowingly 
manipulated the state's wholesale electricity market to drive up prices and 
create artificial shortages. 

It has yet to uncover a ""smoking gun."" But has secured the testimony of 
former Duke Energy (DUK, news, msgs) power plant employees who told the 
committee that the company reduced output at a San Diego power plant during 
power emergencies to drive up power prices. 

The state's Independent System Operator, however, conceded that it ordered 
the fluctuations in capacity at the power plant.

HEADLINE: Energy secretary, former Gov. Wilson speak on energy crisis

BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens

BODY:

??SAN FRANCISCO _ Two prominent Republicans came here on Thursday to promote
free-market solutions to the energy crisis that has hit California and 
threatens
to spread nationwide.

??Spencer Abraham, energy secretary in the Bush administration, only briefly
mentioned the state's current troubles and instead regaled 600 attendees at a
Bay Area Council banquet with the promises of new technologies.

??Earlier, former Gov. Pete Wilson focused on the past as he offered 90 people
at the Public Policy Institute of California a rambling defense of the 1996
electricity industry restructuring law he signed.

??At the heart of electricity industry restructuring is a traditional
Republican theme: a preference for market forces and competition over 
regulators
and government planning. But the fate of California's electricity industry
restructuring plan now rests in the hands of Gray Davis, the state's 
Democratic
governor. ?

??Abraham never mentioned Davis.

??""I didn't come here to play the blame game,"" he said in a news conference.

??California's electricity problems are merely the most intense in a nation
facing ""rising demand, stagnant supplies and an energy (infrastructure) that 
is
out of date and in need of repair,"" he said.

??Picking up on an initiative that has emerged as a priority for some 
advocates
of restructuring, Abraham stressed the need for enhanced federal authority to
meld regional networks of high-voltage transmission lines into a national 
grid.

??But Abraham's main pitch was that California technology companies could
contribute ""intellectual capital and ingenuity to the world of megawatts.""

??Looking far into the new century, he offered a vision of an energy industry
replete with micro turbines, fuel cells and hybrid engines.

??""Our carbon-based economy itself may pass from the scene to be replaced,
perhaps, by a hydrogen- based economy,"" he said.

??Wilson's concerns were more prosaic. He defended restructuring _ now plagued
by soaring prices and rolling blackouts _ as a step forward from the previous
structure, where electricity came from regulated monopolies.

??""There were flaws,"" Wilson said of the restructuring bill that he signed 
into
law in 1996. ""I acknowledge that. They were less important than launching
California on the path to deregulation.""

??Restructuring was the only way to bring down power costs that were higher
than in other states, and to break a regulatory logjam that had limited power
plant development, he said.

??Wilson criticized the law's retail rate freeze. Although it triggered a
financial crisis for the state's utilities, the freeze was largely ""a
self-inflicted wound,"" insisted upon by utilities seeking to be repaid for
costly investments in nuclear plants and contracts with small generators, he
said.

??Wilson also said it had been a mistake to forbid the utilities to sign
long-term contracts with generators. Those were ruled out because regulators
feared such contracts would give utilities an unfair advantage as competition
developed, he said.

??Noting that he had been singled out for criticism by Davis, Wilson fired
back, saying that Davis had been too slow to invoke the ""virtually 
dictatorial""
powers that the governor has in emergencies, including electricity shortages.

??But Wilson expressed some sympathy for Davis, noting that the Legislature
would not have allowed faster power plant siting and construction without a
crisis.

??He also grudgingly complimented his successor's political skills.

??""I admire Gov. Davis' ability to conduct public relations,"" Wilson said,
noting that a visit by President George W. Bush had turned into an ""absolute
public relations triumph for the governor.""

??Wilson echoed some of Davis' themes. Under presidents Clinton and Bush, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's response to the crisis had been ""a bit
slow off the mark,"" Wilson said.

??There remain ""unanswered questions"" about the role of natural gas suppliers,
and whether shortages and high prices in California resulted from ""artificial 
or
real constraints on pipeline capacity,"" he added.

??Generators, while not the cause of the crisis, should also be held to
account.

??""If people have been guilty of gouging, they should pay up,"" he said.

??Wilson said the current troubles are a symptom of the state's failure to 
plan
for growth. The electricity crisis ""will be dwarfed in the future by a water
crisis,"" he warned.

HEADLINE: Edison Bailout Bills Remain Stalled

BYLINE: MIGUEL BUSTILLO, CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Leading lawmakers conceded they would probably leave on their summer break
without passing legislation aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from
its financial straits as competing bailouts stalled in the Legislature 
Thursday.

??The Assembly is expected to consider one of two rival measures to save 
Edison
today, and the Senate is expected to take up an Edison rescue deal of its own.

??But all three pending measures face long odds and none have sufficient
support to clear both houses, legislative leaders said.

??With the Legislature set to quit for the summer as early as today, the
leaders predicted they would be forced to continue negotiations during the
monthlong recess in hopes of brokering a deal.

??""I can't imagine that in the next 24 hours"" lawmakers will reach consensus 
on
an Edison rescue, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), who 
coauthored
one of the lower house's rescue bills with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks).

??One indication of the lack of enthusiasm for the legislation is that Keeley
himself does not support the measure that bears his name. ""I don't believe 
that
this bill in its current form should become law,"" he said. ""This bill is not
ready.""

??The maneuvering in both houses Thursday capped a day of frenetic activity in
the state Capitol, which has become flooded with cell phone-carrying lobbyists
seeking to influence the Edison deal for seemingly every special interest in 
the
state.

??Yet amid the flurry of action, there seemed little chance of actually making
law. Many of the participants said the legislative debate appeared to be less 
an
attempt to pass a bill than a war of one-upsmanship between the houses to see
who could ""lob a grenade"" into the rival house and go home until August. That
way, if Edison soon winds up in Bankruptcy Court, leaders of each house could
argue they were not to blame.

??Hoping to head off a growing sentiment among lawmakers that bankruptcy may
not be such a bad alternative, Gov. Gray Davis spent the day working the 
phones
in hopes of persuading legislators that a government rescue of Edison would be
good for the state.

??To avoid mass blackouts, California has been purchasing billions of dollars
worth of electricity since the beginning of this year because the state's two
largest private utilities, Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, are no longer
credit-worthy enough to buy power on behalf of their customers.

??The utilities lost that status and ran up billions in debt the last two 
years
because they were paying high prices for power on the wholesale market and 
could
not recover those costs from customers because of a state-imposed rate freeze.

??As a result, the state government is stuck in the power-buying business 
until
the utilities regain their financial footing--an expensive predicament that
threatens the state's financial health.

??Davis attempted to head off the crisis by negotiating rescues of the two
utilities, but PG&E lost faith in the talks and opted to take itself into
Bankruptcy Court in April, embarrassing the Democratic governor. 

??Days later, Davis reached a tentative rescue deal with Southern California
Edison. But the plan hit the Legislature with a thud amid concerns it was 
overly
generous to Edison, and it has languished for months.

??Last week, lawmakers finally picked up the pace and began moving forward 
with
a series of competing proposals to alter the governor's deal with Edison. But 
it
was clear from the outset that no consensus had emerged, and many lawmakers 
are
becoming convinced that legislative inaction--even if it means bankruptcy--may
be the best way to resolve Edison's financial predicament.

??""We're bailing out people who don't need to be bailed out,"" said Sen. Ross
Johnson (R-Irvine).

??Legislative leaders hoped to pass something before today when the Assembly
and Senate are scheduled to break for their traditional summer recess. The 
date
is considered important because Edison and Davis had set an Aug. 15 deadline 
for
lawmakers to take action on the rescue deal. If no bill is passed by then--as
seems likely--the utility has the right to walk away from negotiations.

??However, it became evident Thursday that the dueling measures making their
way through both houses lacked strong support.

??In the Assembly, the Hertzberg-Keeley bill, a modification of Davis' 
original
plan, was competing against a rival bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright (D-Los
Angeles), who had teamed with Republicans to push what he bluntly called a
""straight bailout"" of Edison.

??In the Senate, Davis' original plan was amended by Sen. Byron Sher
(D-Stanford) and turned into a trimmed-down rescue plan that was opposed by
Edison.

??Sher's bill was voted down twice in policy committees Wednesday and 
Thursday,
but it was resuscitated both times, and is now on the Senate floor.

HEADLINE: Edison May Avert Bankruptcy Filing;
Energy: Thanks to a rate increase and natural gas price drop, the utility's
improved cash flow may cover its electricity costs.

BYLINE: JERRY HIRSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

??For the first time in months, Southern California Edison is collecting more
money than it is spending on electricity, a shift that could enable the 
utility
to avoid bankruptcy without a state intervention as dramatic as the proposed $
2.8-billion purchase of the company's transmission lines.

??The turnabout has come during the last several weeks as natural gas 
prices--a
major component in the cost of electricity--have plummeted and as Edison has
collected more money from customers through a record increase in rates 
approved
by state regulators.

??The utility this month expects to collect more than it will spend on
electricity--the first time that has happened since the state's power crunch
started in May 2000. If the trend holds, Edison would be able to cover several
hundred million dollars in losses that piled up after Feb. 1 from its 
purchases
of electricity, said executives at the Rosemead-based company.

??Edison's relief comes against a backdrop in which the California power 
crisis
appears to be easing, as consumers conserve energy, new power plants come 
online
and wholesale prices moderate from the high levels of last winter.

??The executives said that barring an unusually severe heat wave, which would
prompt customers to crank up energy-guzzling air conditioners, or another 
spike
in natural gas prices, Edison by early next year also could make payments on a
proposed bond offering to pay down its $3.5 billion in debt from energy
purchases before Feb. 1.

??Creditors of the utility and consultants working with the governor's office
agree that such a scenario could mean that Edison would be able to stay out of
U.S. Bankruptcy Court without the state buying the company's transmission 
lines,
which is a key element in Gov. Gray Davis' now-stalled proposal to rescue the
utility.

??Jim Scilacci, the utility's chief financial officer, has hinted at improving
company finances during conference calls with creditors holding $931 million 
in
defaulted bonds and notes in recent weeks. Investors have responded 
positively,
boosting the company's depressed stock price about 45% in the last six weeks 
to
a Thursday close of $14.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.

??Although Edison's cash flow may be enough to cover its electricity costs, 
its
huge debts keep it far from solvency. Moreover, the company still faces two 
wild
cards in its fight to avoid bankruptcy: California's own claims on that cash 
and
the utility's uncertain prospects of gaining state approval to use the money 
to
repay its debts.

??The Department of Water Resources is buying electricity for 27 million
Californians served by Edison and the state's two other regulated utilities. 
The
agency could disclose as soon as today how big a slice it will take from
Edison's rate collections to repay a proposed $13.4-billion bond offering to
cover the state's purchases.

??The water agency began buying electricity from private generators in 
January,
after Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the Northern California utility,
became mired in debt. PG&E went on to file for bankruptcy protection in April.

??""What this means for Edison all depends on how much money it can keep,"" said
Paul Patterson, an analyst with investment bank ABN Amro in New York.

??The water department's requirements could eat up much of the margin that has
provided Edison with its small cushion this month. However, Joseph Fichera,
chief executive of Saber Partners, which is advising the governor, said the
latest numbers indicate that there is enough money in current rates to 
implement
the governor's plan to pay for the utility's debt as well as the state's 
current
and future power purchases.

??Even if the water department allocation still left room for Edison to pay 
off
its debts, such a course of action would require approval by the state
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission. Although energy trends appear
to allow the utility to regain its financial footing, analysts cautioned that
the utility still could find itself in Bankruptcy Court if the state doesn't
provide a method for Edison to pay its debts.

??""While we might be able to cover our costs going forward, it is equally
important that we have a way to pay off that $3.5-billion debt,"" said Brian
Bennett, an Edison vice president. ""But without knowing what [the water
department's] revenue needs are, we won't know what is left over in rates to
cover our costs.""

??Bennett blamed the utility's so-called under-collection--debts that piled up
as frozen consumer rates could not cover soaring wholesale electricity 
costs--on
what he called ""flawed regulatory policies.""

??Based on recent energy prices, Bennett said, ""We are just only beginning to
repay the under-collection.""

??The recently enacted rate increases, which kicked in last month, have pushed
what Edison can charge customers for the electricity component of their bills
from about 7 cents a kilowatt-hour to 10.27 cents.

??At the same time, declining natural gas prices have sliced in half what the
utility must pay to a group of small and alternative-energy companies that
generate about 27% of its electricity needs. Edison, for example, paid this
group 18.6 cents a kilowatt-hour in February. That dropped to 13.6 cents by 
May
and now stands at about 7.5 cents. Each penny decline in the cost of 
electricity
from this group of generators represents more than $200 million in savings for
Edison on an annual basis.

??Bennett cautioned that if the water department requires additional funds or
if Edison's energy costs were to turn upward again, ""then rates once again may
not be adequate to cover our generation costs. It is therefore imperative that
this uncertainty in the rate structure be cured now so we establish 
predictable,
stable rates for our customers.""

??Three plans to aid Edison to varying degrees are working their way through
the Legislature, though late Thursday it appeared none would be approved 
before
lawmakers adjourn for a summer recess. Several legislators have said they are
content to let Edison join PG&E in bankruptcy.

??Any plan that would allow Edison to use a portion of the rates it is
collecting to pay off a bond offering would meet the objection of some 
consumer
groups, which label the concept a corporate bailout.

??""Just as the utilities gambled on deregulation and were winners at first,
Edison now has to be responsible for its losses,"" said Harvey Rosenfield,
president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. 
He
said Bankruptcy Court is the most appropriate place for Edison to resolve its
financial problems.

??Several creditors of the utility, however, said that as long as Edison can
tread water or even work down its debts, there is little incentive to put the
company into bankruptcy, which would only add another legal layer and more
expenses to an exceptionally complicated situation.

??Creditors could move against the company if they believed its finances were
declining and thus shrinking the amount of cash and assets that could be
distributed in a bankruptcy proceeding. They also could put Edison into
involuntary bankruptcy if some creditors exacted payment from the company 
ahead

HEADLINE: State advisers forced to sell energy stocks;

CONFLICT: Holdings called unethical

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Mark Martin

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
One consultant hired by the state to negotiate long-term electricity contracts
owned stock in a company that signed billion-dollar deals with California.

???Another fresh hire bought more than $10,000 in stock in Enron Corp. -- the
Houston power trader frequently vilified by Gov. Gray Davis and lawmakers -- 
as
he helped the state develop electricity buying strategy.

???A top Davis lawyer told the two consultants and seven others on Wednesday
morning to sell off stock in companies like Enron and Calpine Corp. within 
four
hours or lose their jobs.

???Having a financial interest in electric companies while working for the
state on power issues was not ethical, said Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs
secretary, in a memo.

???All nine complied with the directive, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio
said, but controversy intensified yesterday over whether some of the state's
hired guns managing the energy crisis have conflicts of interest.

???The stock investments have come to light in the past week as 35 consultants
hired by the state to buy and schedule power and to negotiate energy contracts
have submitted documents detailing their personal finances.

???Most of the consultants who owned stock list their jobs as schedulers --
those who schedule electricity deliveries after power has been purchased.

???But others more directly involved with power trading also owned stock in
energy companies, documents show.

???Richard Ferreira earns $200 an hour to help negotiate and manage the 
state's
long-term contracts with power companies. He started his job Jan. 31.

???According to Ferreira's financial statement, he owned between $2,000 and $
10,000 worth of stock in Calpine Corp. -- the company based in San Jose that
announced on Feb. 28 it had signed two long-term contracts with the state 
worth
$8.3 billion.

???Ferreira could not be reached for comment, and spokesmen for the Department
of Water Resources, which hired the consultants, said he did not know if
Ferreira worked on the Calpine contracts.

???Another consultant, Richard Nichols, bought between $10,000 and $100,000
worth of stock in Enron in April -- more than three months after his company
signed on with the state to help ""in the procurement of power supplies,""
according to his job description. The stock buy came at a time when the 
Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission was taking a hard line against wholesale
electricity price caps for California.

???Nichols' company, Navigant Consulting, Inc., could make as much as $800,000
for its work for the state this year. Nichols could not be reached for 
comment.

???Citing invoices from Controller Kathleen Connell's office, Secretary of
State Bill Jones, an announced GOP candidate for governor, argued that there 
are
at least seven other Navigant employees who are billing the state for work on
energy issues. None of them have disclosed their financial interests.

???Jones said he takes issue with the Davis administration's decisions on who
should file financial statements and who should be exempt.

???FINANCES NOT DISCLOSED

???Several consultants, including two Wall Street firms that made $275,000 a
month to negotiate the state's attempts to bail out troubled public utilities,
have not disclosed their finances because Davis officials have concluded they 
do
not fit the definition of a consultant.

???Jones has suggested that the state's long-term deals with several companies
to deliver electricity might be invalid if negotiators had a financial stake 
in
those companies.

???Maviglio said Davis officials were investigating whether there had been any
direct conflicts. The state attorney general's office and the state's Fair
Political Practices Commission also are reviewing Jones' allegations.

???Maviglio and a spokesman for the state's Department of Water and Power 
could
not say yesterday whether new employees were asked before they were hired
whether they had any financial stake in the energy market.

???STOCKS SOLD VOLUNTARILY

???But some consultants acknowledged a potential conflict and got rid of 
stocks
before this week. In his filing, Mark Skowdronski reports owning more than $
10,000 worth of Reliant Energy stocks when he began his job in March of
negotiating long-term contracts for the state. When he was given the task of
negotiating with Reliant, he said he sold his stock on March 20.

???Jones has stopped short of accusing anyone of criminal activity. And a
letter from Attorney General Bill Lockyer to Jones notes that the consultants
would have to own more than 3 percent of a company they dealt with to be
prosecuted criminally.

???Maviglio said the accusations come from a man who is launching his run for
Davis' job next year.

???""This is all politics,"" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. ""We're
following the law.""

???He said that when the state was forced to enter the business of buying 
power
earlier this year, officials had to quickly hire people who knew the energy
business, including some who still had investments in power companies.

???""If you want a plumber, you hire a guy who has plumbing experience,""
Maviglio said.E-mail Mark Martin at markmartin@sfchronicle.com.

HEADLINE: Democrats defy Davis with bill on PUC;

Utilities panel would keep power over rates

SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Lawmakers moved with lightning speed yesterday to undo a plan that would force
California regulators to raise electricity rates whenever state power buyers
deem it necessary.

???A hastily introduced bill pits Democratic lawmakers against the
administration of Gov. Gray Davis, which is counting on the state Public
Utilities Commission to approve rate increases to pay for electricity without
questioning whether the state got a good price.

???Historically, utilities bought their electricity and asked the PUC to
approve rate hikes. The PUC decided whether the requests were justified.

???But with the utilities now deeply in debt and the state buying electricity,
the old system has broken down. This week, the PUC issued a draft agreement 
that
would guarantee the state would get as much money as it needs to pay for the
electricity it is buying.

???Consumer advocates said the proposed agreement would force the PUC to cede
its responsibility to protect customers from unreasonable rate increases.

???Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, called the agreement
""overreaching"" by the governor's Department of Water Resources, which is 
buying
the state's power.

???Under Burton's bill, consumers would still have to repay $13.4 billion in
bonds that the state plans to float to cover its purchases. But the bill would
allow the PUC to scrutinize the state's expenses beyond those covered by the
bond -- costs mounting to billions of dollars over the next 15 to 20 years.

???The bill passed out of two committees with bipartisan support yesterday and
now faces a vote by the full Senate. Both business and consumer groups 
expressed
their support for the measure.

???""This is better for ratepayers,"" said Lenny Goldberg of the Utility Reform
Network. ""It makes the bond issue secure and gives a chance to look into all 
of
the contracts.""

???PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said some change is needed to restore
commission oversight.

???""The only check and balance on the Department of Water Resources as it is
would be the governor,"" Bilas said. ""I think it takes a different branch of
government to do that oversight.""

???But Bruce Van Dusen, a lawyer hired by the Department of Water Resources,
said Burton's bill could delay the bond sale and jeopardize the general fund.

???The concern is that while Burton's bill guarantees that the bond issue 
would
be repaid, it does not spell out how all the long-term electricity contracts
that the state has signed will be covered. The contracts stipulate that the
generators will be paid through electricity rates.Chronicle staff writer

HEADLINE: More energy fallout

BODY:
THEY SAY nothing is fair in love and war. It isn't. But nor is it fair when it
comes to energy.

???In Washington, Vice President Dick Cheney, champion of the drill-and-burn
industry, asks the Navy to foot the electric bills for his mansion.

???At the same time, the vice president refuses to disclose the costs incurred
by his energy task force or to reveal the hot shots from the oil and gas
industry who helped shape its final policies.

???Closer to home, California residents brace for the aftershocks of the 
energy
crisis. With the state now locked into secret, long-term and costly energy
contracts, it is the public -- not the energy suppliers who made out like
bandits -- who will be burdened by the billions spent purchasing electricity.

???At present, only 39 percent of those surveyed approve of the way Gov. Gray
Davis has handled this crisis. Approval may drop even lower when California 
residents absorb the astonishing news that we suddenly enjoy an energy surplus
and that our state is now selling it on a glutted market.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Sara,

The following items are outstanding issues with respect to the 
above-referenced ISDA:

1. Arizona Public Service Company plans on executing the ISDA as Arizona 
Public Service Company, on behalf of its Bulk Power Marketing Resource 
Operations Division (""BPMROD"").  It is APSC's intent in the future to create 
a new entity for this division, such new entity to enter into all trading 
transactions.  As a result, it is ASPC's desire to  modify the definition of 
""Specified Transaction"" to only include transactions between Party A and 
BPMROD.

2. Procedures for Entering into Transactions - ASPC would like 5 days to 
dispute or accept confirmations.  Apparently, all of their agreements provide 
for 5 days, therefore any shorter time period could cause problems for them.  
I had previously offered 3 days.

3. Part 5 (f) Recording - ASPC wants to consent to recordings on ""trading 
lines only"".  They do not want to consent to officers (non-traders) being 
recorded if the communication does not occur on a trading line.

4. Part 5 (g)(B) - Setoff -  ASPC wants to delete ""or any of its Affiliates"" 
from this section.  ASPC thinks this issue is related to their issue in #1 
above.  I don't see why.  What do you think?  I assume that we are not 
willing to strike ""or any of its Affiliates"".

The only other issue is a credit issue which I am handling with Paul Radous.  
So, we're close.  Let me know what you think.

Legal is requesting some information for the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing related to the merger by the end of the day tomorrow.  Please see below.  I have listed the description of the codes below.  The information is requested for the year 2000.  Please provide a list of states in which Enron subsidiaries (entities incorporated in the U.S. only) which earned revenues in 2000 (1) have customers, (2) conduct their operations, or (3) have physical office locations (as specified below) for the following NAICS codes only.  The revenues should include intercompany revenues.

I am attaching a file which was compiled a few months ago, containing the largest Enron companies earning revenues in 2000 and their respective NAICS codes.  This is not all-inclusive, but is a good start.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Item Description:
	53cm (21 in) Cannondale Criterium Road/Racing Bike

You are bidding on an aluminum frame Cannondale Criterium, Model 8R300, 53cm bicycle.
I am the original and only owner of this bike. This bike is white with blue lettering. The components are the original Suntour Accushift alpha-3040 group. Also included are: Time criterium pedals with shoe cleats, a Profile Aerobar, a Cateye Vectra CC-7000 computer
(needs battery), Mistral rims, a Vetta saddle, and Diacompe brakes. I am also including a Zefel hp
X3 pump that fits nicely beneath the top tube, which is not shown. The small blue saddle bag shown in the photo is the only accessory not included.

This bike has been hanging in my garage by the stem and saddle (not by the rims) for the last few
years. The tires have gone down, but will hold air for a few days. It does have a few paint chips on the front fork (see photo) and there is surface rust in these chips, on the rear freewheel, and on
the chain.

With a good cleaning, good lube, and new rubber this will be an awesome bike at a great price. Don't miss this great chance to get atop Cannondale Craftsmanship.

Shipping: I will take to this bike to a bicycle shop in the 37127 or 37064 area for packaging and shipping. Winning bidder will pay the final bid plus actual packaging and shipping costs.
I estimate about $50 total S&H. Call your local bike shop, or call a bike shop in the zipcode areas listed to get an estimate.

Payment: If you want to use a credit card for payment you can click on the Bidpay icon below to order a
Bidpay money order. I will also accept payment by check (must clear my credit union) or US money
order (ships upon receipt).

Other: I reserve the right to cancel this auction as this bike is also for sale locally.

Good Luck and thank for looking!

This email contains legal advice

Hoyt and Melissa,

I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort 
of services for MG/RW.  It looks like there may be some key personnel we want 
to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.   I am not 
really familiar with the specific facts here.

The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract 
personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their 
activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and 
other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  So, if the plan is 
to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an 
employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a 
supervisor.  Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.

If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers 
-- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.    It 
is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting 
agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other 
alternative).  Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people 
who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk 
of the contract workers.

I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a 
definitive conclusion.  So, let's try to discuss it.  I am booked until about 
11 this morning, but am available after that.

Subject: Priviliged and Confidential communication to my attorney Re: Henry 
Bath LA  

Melissa, my concern is that we may get hit with what is called a 
""co-employment suit"" in the US.  This is where an agency employee claims that 
he/she was treated like an employee, therefore he/she should get employee 
benefits (vs. benefits from the agency company, which are probably weak).  
Since we did a share purchase of MG, if the agency employees filed a suit 
against MG claiming that they are really employees, I think that we would 
have to defend it.

I am not an attorney, but I am going to send this to Michelle Cash, who can 
advise us on the position we should take.  I would think that if we single 
out certain employees to become Enron employees and the remainder stay as 
agency employees, this would enhance the legal position of the agency 
employees (versus everyone staying as an agency employee).  Michelle, can you 
help us with this one?  Thanks.

Melissa, I also think we should minimize distribution on this discussion . .

Subject: Henry Bath LA

Hi Hoyt,

I have today spoken to Ed Dablin regarding Henry Bath LA.  We discussed how 
the employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees, although they are 
infact agency workers.  Ed confirmed that Martha and half a dozen other 
employees quite clearly should become Enron employees and should get 
applicable benefits.

The other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should 
become Enron employees and should remain as agency staff.

He realises that the original granting of Share Options has slightly ""muddied 
the water"" with regard to whether these employees are employees of Enron or 
the agency.  He was not involved with the original decision to grant these 
employees Share Options.

We discussed the issues (in broad terms, as I could not remember all of the 
specific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals 
Enron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy 
thing to do.  

However, this is his ideal scenario.  How viable is it that we can do this 
for him?

He also made the point that Martha is the most senior executive in Henry Bath 
Inc. and is one of his most valuable employees.

Regards

Melissa

Robin, our GISB is a standardized contract that very rarely contains any 
specific credit covenants.  I do not provide credit terms to Legal for GISB 
contracts and they do not keep me informed of any's execution.  Should you 
like to have your customer review an Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Sale

I'd like to have the information as soon as it is available each month.  I don't know what the regular close schedule is so I don't know when it would be safe to extract the data and be sure that you have the entire month's activity.  Our expense close is on the fifth workday so I'd like to aim for  a date as close to there as is possible.

Karl,

Here is a file with December's data from our QA environment.  The program that produces this data will be in production later today, so I'll get you a file from PR1 then.  I had to zip it up because it was too big to deliver.  I'll set you up with an userid and password so you can pick these up off our interface server once it is scheduled in production.

I'm now settled in London.  If you need to reach me, I'm at 783-4269 (trunk+34269).

Thanks,

Go to FAO Schwartz, they'll take care of you.  You can never go wrong with Barbies.  You can also ask her mother what she wants.  Of course my strategy was always to buy things that either made the biggest mess (paint, giant Play-Doh), had the most pieces, or made a lot of noise.  That way your niece loves you and your sister hates you.  Two wins in my book.

It's out ...

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE=09September 20, 2001
CONTACT: PG&E News Department (415) 973-5930

PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PG&E CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANI=
ZATION=20
Plan Pays Claims in Full, Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State =
Bailout
(San Francisco, CA)- PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) and its utility unit Paci=
fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in U.S.=
 Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa=
y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy p=
roceedings. The official creditors' committee supports the plan.
""This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=
tioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=
icity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=
thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout,"" said Robert D. Glynn,=
 Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=
esident of PG&E Corporation.  ""And, the plan will enable us to provide long=
-term growth prospects to shareholders."" =20
The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =
into two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=
her. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =
and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=
m.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=
ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=
art of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=
nd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.
The electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=
ons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=
he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=
c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=
structures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=
atisfy creditor claims.=20
Under the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=
bination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=
itors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=
ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=
eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=
tive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=
t of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=
ed claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=
sh and 40 percent in notes.
 =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =
Corporation will be organized as follows:=20

?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=
ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=
ts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=
f the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=
0 people.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu=
ll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20

?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus=
iness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=
c generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=
y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20

The new electric generation business will be a California company establish=
ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=
ssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=
s, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=
00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =
with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=
eping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=
ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=
pany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20
The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi=
shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u=
tility.  The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission=
 lines and cables.
The new gas transmission business will be a California company established =
to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b=
y the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga=
s storage facilities. =20
Following the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi=
ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i=
ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates.  The Federal Energy Regulat=
ory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses =
for the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic=
e provided by the electric transmission business.  FERC will also assume ju=
risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear =
Power Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga=
s transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20
Glynn said, ""This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli=
able and long-term electric supply to California customers.  It enables our=
 company to maintain a qualified workforce.  And it enables us to keep our =
generating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal=
 to pay creditors.""
The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o=
f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas=
 and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent=
ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga=
nization.=20
""We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to=
 do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs,"" said =
Glynn.  ""We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t=
he people who know how to run them best.""
In addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for cu=
stomers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta=
te.  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power=
 for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi=
bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R=
esources.
The Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately =

I  called his agency to alert them to some of the issues we discussed (i.e. taking long breaks and leaving the office for appointments outside of his job).  I suspect they have spoken to him because now we are getting emails every time he leaves his desk and every time he returns.  

I would, more than anything, like to replace him before we get into the thick of the PRC process, and I am anxious to know what the outcome of the inquiry is so that I may consider options.   

Thanks in advance,

The demand is .03,  the ACA is .0022 and the commodity and fuel is

If you use STX to M3, the commodity is .0623,  ETX or ELA  to M3, the

I haven't heard from you in a while.  I know, I know, you haven't heard from 
me either.  I wanted to check in and see how you're doing.  I talked to 
Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my 
family and I are praying for you guys.  I know everyone says this but if 
there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas 
shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got 
to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a 
hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing 
really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be 
running marathons by now.  

I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right 
now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right 
now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this 
month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each 
day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one 
week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact 
I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this 
afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day.  

Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.

0,"Stacey, 

I was in the MSN DSL pilot.  As you know MSN is no longer providing DSL 
through Northpoint.  You told me that Enron would not subsidize SWB DSL 
service which is what MSN suggested I sign up for.  What did Enron decide to 
do about DSL?  I could not tell from the ClickAtHome intranet.

0,"Some additional thoughts on the force majeure issue--i.e., are we cutting off 
shippers' supply due to force majeure?  

1.    If the gas at the point is out of spec on water, the answer is clearly 
no.  We're shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the 
tariff quality spec., not due to force majeure.  We have the discretion to 
grant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent 
operators and so long as we don't discriminate.   If that gas is out of spec 
on any of the specific items listed in the ""Quality"" section of the tariff 
(Sec. 44?  47?  I can't remember which but its one of those) then the answer 
is the same.  

2.  If the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons, I think the 
answer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons 
falling out as liquids.  I'm remembering the catch all section of the Quality 
paragraph as prohibiting ""dirt, gums, and other impurities that would 
interfere with the operation of compressors, blah blah"" or something to that 
effect.  That catch all seems to me to include liquids.  IF the c6 and 
heavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids, then the people 
delivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas--therefore no 
force majeure.   I read Eric's very scientific email and I think the punch 
line was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids--right?   The 
thing I can't remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. 
limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers 
are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn't 
work as good.  

3.  If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we 
could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  Generally, an 
event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic.

I'll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  DF"

Do you think that a bill favorable to energy will be passed over the strong

significant change if Treasury is not longer against us -- but it is a little

Subject: RE: RESULTS OF MAN NIGHT

Ok...I thought the addition of ""life partners"" to the table simply intensified the revelry normally associated with ""Man Night""...                 it was like the testosterone crescendoed to its normal Deer-lease range once the ""other side"" joined our fray. Up until that point, I thought everyone's mini-meetings regarding isolated work-related gibberish was very non Man-like, almost to the point of boredom. Thank God ""They"" arrived b/c they brought out the best in the ""Men"".

It was either that or the $190.00 worth of alcoholic beverages that did it.

RE: The food...

Salsa was uninspired...but had good bite.
Queso is queso when doctored with proper amounts of capsicum, thus pushing the Scoville Units up to an acceptable level.
Mexican Seafood Cocktail...Good effort at the traditional version, albeit the least adventuresome. They make one that has shrimp,crab, octopus, squid, fish, etc. that would have gone over even better with the organ meat eaters. Does not compare to Goode Co.'s version, which is Tex-Mex'ized. Must be why Joe thought it was Ketchup....This version,  which I have eaten in Mexico is nothing more than Ceviche'ized random seafood, Pico, and the Mexican equivalent of V8 juice. Served with lime wedges and saltine crackers, like the natives do it.

Fish and Shrimp Main Course....Thought the fish was exceptionally fresh and tasty. Enjoyed the ""Diablo"" version the best w/ the corn tortillas and Guacamole. Very unique item seldom seen on menus. Would go back just for that. The shrimp suffered from too long in the fryer disease. It needs to be started in the fryer, cooked 1/4 of the way to render the bacon fat away, then finished over a char-grill to give it a smoky flavor. That step seemed to have been left out...fryer the whole time. They probably don't even have a char-grill.

Ritas- ""Rocas"" were good, Frozen was non-descript. Dos XX reliable as always. Perhaps we will get Michaladas next time, as discussed.
Overall...I'd go back, like I said, just for that fish!!!!

(i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought 
they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the

Subject: Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process

Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor, I wanted to confirm our collective 
understanding/proposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the 
financial trading process in Canada.  As you are all aware, all financial 
confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm 
desk in Calgary.  However, it seems that there has been some confusion 
relating to the legal procedures associated with this process.

In short, I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process 
regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for 
Canadian physical confirms.  That is, as is currently the process for 
physical deals, the Canadian confirm desk will generate all deal tickets and, 
to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward, will 
generate, have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation 
letters, with no involvement of the legal department.  However, for any 
financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms 
(as well as amendments), just as with physical transactions, the confirm desk 
will generate the deal ticket and provide it to Linda or Sharon in Calgary.  
Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the 
deal tickets, which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark 
Powell.  Once approved, the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing 
lawyer, checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review, 
approve and have executed.  The executed confirm will then be returned to 
either Linda or Sharon, who will attend to distributing it to the 
counterparty.  Again, this will only be required for transactions which are 
out of the ordinary.

With respect to negotiating and implementing, and addressing ongoing legal 
concerns with respect to, ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, Mark Taylor's 
group, and I understand specifically Mary Cook, will continue to have 
responsibility for such matters.  Therefore, to the extent that we need to 
put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal 
concerns about the implementation of the ISDA, the process will be the same 
as it has been in the past, meaning that those matters will be dealt with in 
Houston.

Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing 
initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations, I think it is essential 
that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run 
each of Sharon and Linda (as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggy's 
group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters) through her 
ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our 
legal group to deal with these matters.  As well, we will need to ensure that 
Linda and Sharon receive (either from Houston or Dianne) electronic versions 
of all confirmation precedents (ie. confirm forms, amendment forms, etc.) 
necessary for them to properly undertake these activities.

If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me.  Otherwise, I think we should implement these 
procedures as soon as possible, including having Tana join us for a few crisp 
winter days in Calgary.

Thanks

Greg

Subject:	Dynegy v. ComEd update

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Dear Vince:

I just wanted to get in touch with you, as my last fall semester here
draws to a close and this is something of a transition point for me.  To
update you on my job search, I have been extended an offer for a position
within Enron's Analyst Program.  The offer was very attractive and I had
numerous things to consider in reaching my decision.  Unfortunately, I
will be declining Enron's offer of employment to take a position in the
Investment Banking Division of Salomon Smith Barney in New York.  My
preference at this point is to live outside of Houston, and although my
hope is also to return to Houston in future, New York offers some
exciting options for me now.  I will be starting there in July of this
summer.  I hope that I will have future opportunities to be an advocate
of Enron and look forward to keeping in touch with you and the Research
Group.

Please give my regards to everyone at the office and wishes for a very
happy holiday season!  Also please feel free to contact me at any time.
I can give you my future contact information when I have it.

Thank you and I hope I'll see you again.

Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression 
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a 
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make 
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a 
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and 
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE 
compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.   
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental 
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental 
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the 
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it 
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing 
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure 
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other 
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression 
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights 
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more 
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for 
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed 
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should 
be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after 
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  
Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close 
after Noon on June 23, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value 
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on 
this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

CalPX To Ask FERC To Reduce Day-of, Day-Ahead Price Cap:
Board Caves In To Political Pressure

By Jason Leopold

LOS ANGELES--The California Power Exchange, the spot market where electricity 
is
bought and sold in the state, approved a measure Wednesday seeking federal
authority to impose a
$350 per megawatt-hour bid cap on wholesale power prices in its day-of and
day-ahead markets.

Members of the CalPX's board of governors admitted that the measure was 
approved
 as a result of
intense political pressure being placed on the board by state lawmakers and 
Gov.
 Gray Davis.

""Not approving this is political suicide,"" said CalPX board member Carolyn
Keherein, who also serves
on the board of governors at the California Independent System Operator. 
""We're
not changing
anything but the perception in the market.""

The CalPX current cap on wholesale power prices in the day-of and day-ahead
market is set at $2,500,
but that is only a technical limitation of their computer system and has had 
no
effect on power prices.

State lawmakers believe a price cap would stabilize high power prices being
passed on to retail
customers, most notably consumers in San Diego. Ratepayers there are paying
market-based rates for
electricity and have seen their utility bills nearly triple in the past two
months.

The price cap would need to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission before it goes
into effect at the Power Exchange. FERC has not indicated whether it would OK
the measure, but said
it would investigate it.



If you have any questions, please feel free to call me directly.

Roger, and could likely be correct.  But we need to determine whether we can 
get what we need by doing a ""less precise"" annual versus a ""monthly.""  Seems 
that once we've made that call, we direct the scenario and they do it.  
Thoughts?

Robert,

Thanks for the note. A conference call at 12:30 pm PST would work for us.
However, on that call, we will not be able to present results of the
additional scenarios that you defined in your e-mail. The model that we
used was an annual rate model. The analysis that you are proposing would
require a monthly model, which would take additional time to develop.
Perhaps we should discuss this prior to the call at 2:30 pm CST. Roger and
I will give you a call when we get into the office on Wednesday morning.
This should be around 11 am CST.

Best regards,

Bill

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian

0,"Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria."

Dutch,

I've attached a spreadsheet which lists volumes for a prepay with the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia (originator is Gil Muhl).  The volumes are not ratable over time, so I thought it might be easier for you to cut and paste the schedule into your model.  The term is November 1, 2001 - October 31, 2006.  The average daily volume is around 78,000 mmBtu/day.

I'm looking for your notional offer - This won't close until Q4.  Please call me if you have any questions - thanks for your help!

 Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into 
our
gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited 
number 
of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity 
somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: 
For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering 
and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, 
Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" 
affected 
are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 
3218, 
3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and 
3213
for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there 
does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression 
agreements
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
existing
compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications 
it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion 
recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time 
frames.
We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the 
application 
process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once 
granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity
will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for
incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will 
award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the 
incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be 
included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
                                Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after
June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. 
Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close after
Noon on June 12, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of 
your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

I have made reservations for Jason's Bachelor Party.  You are the chosen
few.  The cruise is set for Sat. Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport.
Transportation will be arranged for you.  We need to leave at about 5 pm on
the 19th.  I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future
e-mail.  The final tally will be $32 a person. I have paid for this already
so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that
money on gambling.  Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the
Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.

Let me know if you have any questions.

-Eric

Shalesh told me that his visited his HR screen some time ago and it showed a promotion to an Associate.
This entry was reversed later.

Any reason for that? It may be related to his transfer from EBS.
We can check with his previous business unit whether they gave /promised him a promotion.

Subject:	Promotion issue

Vince,

As per our conversation yesterday I would very much appreciate it if you could help me with this matter.  I was under the impression that I would be promoted to Associate this August, which according to my pay stub and eHRonline hasn't occurred.  According to the A/A rules, a copy of which I am attaching below, an Analyst can be promoted to Associate if he/she falls under one of the criteria among several.  The one I believe I am eligible under states:

-  completed 2 years in the Program; have a performance rating of Excellent or above; and have either (1) an appropriate graduate degree or (2)  1 year of relevant commercial work experience prior to Enron

Please let me know if there is anything else you need from me to look into this issue.  Thank you very much for your time and help.

Shalesh

Subject: Certain revisions to LLC Agreement

Attached is a copy of the last draft of the LLC Agreement prepared by
ENA which I have revised to incorporate the changes discussed in your
recent telephone conversation with Doug Pedigo.  In the interest of
time, I have not revised the attached LLC Agreement to reflect the
substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.

Section 6.1(c)(iii) was revised to reflect Sweetgum's right to freely
assign its LLC interest.  Section 6.2(a) was revised to reflect
Sweetgum's right to exercise the call at any time if it either obtains
or waives the GE consent.  Section 6.2(c) was revised to allow ENA to
exercise its put at any time (i) if it obtains GE's consent in form and
substance satisfactory to Sweetgum in its sole discretion or (ii) after
all GE warranties have expired.

To expedite matters, I am forwarding these changes to you at the same
time I am forwarding them to Doug.

Jonda,

I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me and
my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I have
cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails (trying
to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to do that
so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will forward
them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I really
think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or she is
mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to go
over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury trial?
Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the something to
Tonya?  I don't understand....

I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting for work
(not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after 3:30.
I hope that helps

Thanks again,

-Joe

Subject:	CA Proceeding; exposure; netting of purchases & sales; offset of receivables

I called a meeting among Linda Robertson, Gary Fergus, Amanda Smith and RA yesterday evening to compare notes on the status of the captioned matters and determine what activities we would need to undertake going forward.  The following matters were discussed:

1.	Refund exposure / netting of purchases and sales
2.	Receivable from ISO related to business conducted in various trade months
3.	Receivable from PX related to business conducted in various trade months
4.	Receivable related to the underscheduling penalty
5.	Receivable related to the negative CTC

1.	Regarding the first matter, Gary reviewed with us the initial numbers on California exposure relating to our sales in the ISO and PX markets, and our purchases in those markets which may potentially be used to offset this exposure.  We discussed the need to update this study in view of the new data recently provided by the ISO in the proceeding.  Gary will work with Charles River to move forward on this.  The new exposure/netting numbers should be available either at the end of this week, or the middle of next week, due to demands on Charles River related to a Monday filing deadline in the Pac NW proceeding.  A ""block forward"" issue related to our accounting for sales and purchases, and involving the inclusion of price data related to non-physical, swap transactions, will also be analyzed by Charles River to determine its effect on the numbers that are being generated by the ISO and its impact on our refund exposure.  

2.	I shared information related to money owed us by the ISO for business conducted in various trade months, developed with the help of Kit Blair.  This info takes the form of a certification by the chief financial officer of the ISO as to the correctness of various attached information, schedules and invoices generated by ISO and related to these various trade months.  Kit advises as of yesterday that we are owed $42,891,411 by the ISO.

3.	Information was also shared with regard to amounts owed us by the PX for business conducted in various trade months.  This info took the form of an EPMI account summary on PX letterhead and an overview spread sheet (with accompanying backup data) apparently provided by ISO.  The contact person on this matter is Chris Stokley.  I do not have confirmation on an up to date figure yet from Chris, but my prior notes indicate that this receivable is approximately $8MM.

4.	I also shared information on money due us by virtue of the underscheduling penalty mechanism.  Again, Kit Blair provided me this info, which consists of an ISO generated notice and schedule which indicates that EPMI is owed $33,838,246.08

5.	Finally, I shared a spread sheet obtained from Wanda Curry, as to the magnitude of the negative CTC receivable.

The deliverables coming out of the meeting were for Gary and Amanda to take the lead in updating and developing the foregoing items into evidentiary proof/affidavits suitable for use in the proceeding, coordinating with us, Dan Watkiss / Shelby Kelley and the various contacts.  A listing of the contacts to be made and potential affiants/witnesses follows: 

Contact for amounts owed us by ISO- 	Kit Blair, Staff Trading Supt.
Contact for amounts owed us by PX-		Chris Stokley, Associate
Affiant for the info developed above-	Murray O'Neil, Sr. Director Trading Supt.	 
Contact and affiant for negative CTC- 	Wanda Curry, VP Risk Management
Offset of purchases and sales-		Undefined; possibilities- Jan Acton, Seabron Adamson, 							internal person?

I am available for the remainder of the week to help coordinate Gary and Amanda's communication with these contacts.  Alan Comes will be the primary coordinator next week during my absence; although I will be reachable on my cell should the need arise. 

Thanks,  Ray

Subject: Re: O&M Variance - 1998 to 2000  

I want to have the detail schedule fixed to include themost recent forecast 
and plans, including the plan for 2000.    Where there are obvious reclasses 
(like variable pay in 1999 vs 1998) then I want those made comparable.   This 
schedule has to somehow be made more usable.   I would suggest putting all 
the O&M and G&A in one bucket to avoid the shifting around explanations 
possibly.   Also on the revenue side can we get revenue broken down by North, 
South and Offshore?

I don't see any other items in the historical file like the Y2K costs.  It 
was an issue of whether these costs were truly incremental or not.  Over the 
years, there have been numerous shifts in philosophy regarding recurring 
versus non-recurring.  We have attempted to go back to 1993 and make the 
methodology more consistent between years with the information that we had 
available.

Tracy,  I will send you a revised Detail Income Statement file for the Plan 
because it includes 1999.

Are there any other things like this in this table?     The only split that 
really matters in this table is the recurring/non-recurring split.

Subject: O&M Variance - 1998 to 2000

In 1999, we treated the increase in expense for Y2K as recurring, but 
reflected the deferral as non-recurring.  It probably would have been more 
appropriate to treat both the increase and deferral as non-recurring.  We 
will change the historical file to reflect that methodology.  This will 
decrease the 1999 recurring Direct O&M by $3.5MM on NNG and $.4MM on TW.  The 
attached file reflects the changes.  This does not have any effect on total 
O&M or IBIT, only the split between recurring and non-recurring.

Harry,  here is the explanation.  The biggest portion is the variable pay 
which was not part of G&A in 1998 $4.6MM and then we expensed Y2K of $3.5MM.

0,"All, 
I received a call from Sally Beck today alerting me to concerns about spreading the risk group across the floor (gas team - power team).  From a control perspective she prefers that the team be all together.  

Can you factor this in and give Sally and me your thoughts as well?  Perhaps we could find an area that is more central to both groups that will help with this (as we've done with fundies).  

Scott and I are meeting Tuesday afternoon at 4:00 - Lloyd and Sally are you free to join us to keep us all on the same page?  Please let me know so I can reserve a room.

Subject: Analysis of Supreme Court decision


A friend sent me the following Q&A - it sums up the legal issues very
clearly.

--------------

Q: I'm not a lawyer and I don't understand the recent Supreme Court decision
in Bush v. Gore. Can you explain it to me?

A: Sure. I'm a lawyer. I read it. It says Bush wins, even if Gore got the
most votes.

Q: But wait a second. The US Supreme Court has to give a reason, right?

A: Right.

Q: So Bush wins because hand-counts are illegal?

A: Oh no. Six of the justices (two-thirds majority) believed the hand-counts
were legal and should be done.

Q: Oh. So the justices did not believe that the hand-counts would find any
legal ballots?

A. Nope. The five conservative justices clearly held (and all nine justices
agreed) ""that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate
number of ballots which are not punched in a clean, complete way by the
voter."" So there are legal votes that should be counted but can't be.

Q: Oh. Does this have something to do with states' rights? Don't
conservatives love that?

A: Generally yes. These five justices have held that the federal government
has no business telling a sovereign state university it can't steal trade
secrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law. Nor does the
federal government have any business telling a state that it should bar guns
in schools. Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clause
to force states to take measures to stop violence against women.

Q: Is there an exception in this case?

A: Yes, the Gore exception. States have no rights to have their own state
elections when it can result in Gore being elected President. This decision
is limited to only this situation.

Q: C'mon. The Supremes didn't really say that. You're exaggerating.

A: Nope. They held ""Our consideration is limited to the present
circumstances, or the problem of equal protection in election processes
generally presents many complexities.""

Q: What complexities?

A: They don't say.

Q: I'll bet I know the reason. I heard Jim Baker say this. The votes can't
be counted because the Florida Supreme Court ""changed the rules of the
election after it was held."" Right?

A. Dead wrong. The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida Supreme
Court did not change the rules of the election. But the US Supreme Court
found the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong.

Q: Huh?

A: The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting vote
is ""clear intent of the voter."" The Florida Court was condemned for not
adopting a clearer standard.

Q: I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislature's
law after the election.

A: Right.

Q: So what's the problem?

A: They should have. The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Court
should have ""adopt[ed] adequate statewide standards for determining what is
a legal vote""

Q: I thought only the Legislature could ""adopt"" new law.

A: Right.

Q: So if the Court had adopted new standards, I thought it would have been
overturned.

A: Right. You're catching on.

Q: If the Court had adopted new standards, it would have been overturned for
changing the rules. And if it didn't, it's overturned for not changing the
rules. That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did, legal
votes could never be counted.

A: Right. Next question.

Q: Wait, wait. I thought the problem was ""equal protection,"" that some
counties counted votes differently from others. Isn't that a problem?

A: It sure is. Across the nation, we vote in a hodgepodge of systems. Some,
like the optical-scanners in largely Republican-leaning counties record
99.7% of the votes. Some, like the punchcard systems in largely
Democratic-leaning counties record only 97% of the votes. So approximately
3% of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can.

Q: Aha! That's a severe equal-protection problem!!!

A: No it's not. The Supreme Court wasn't worried about the 3% of Democratic
ballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida. That ""complexity"" was not a
problem.

Q: Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked more
than 20,000 Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan.

A: Nope. The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got his
highest, best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home with
Holocaust survivors, who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler.

Q: Yikes. So what was the serious equal protection problem?

A: The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the 3% of Democrats
(largely African-American) disenfranchised. The problem is that somewhat
less than .005% of the ballots may have been determined under slightly
different standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing their
best to accomplish the legislative mandate of ""clear intent of the voter""
may have a slightly opinion about the voter's intent.

Q: Hmmm. OK, so if those votes are thrown out, you can still count the votes
where everyone agrees the voter's intent is clear?

A: Nope.

Q: Why not?

A: No time.

Q: No time to count legal votes where everyone, even Republicans, agree the
intent is clear? Why not?

A: Because December 12 was yesterday.

Q: Is December 12 a deadline for counting votes?

A: No. January 6 is the deadline. In 1960, Hawaii's votes weren't counted
until January 4.

Q: So why is December 12 important?

A: December 12 is a deadline by which Congress can't challenge the results.

Q: What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court?

A: Nothing.

Q: But I thought ---

A: The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete its
work by December 12 to make things easier for Congress. The United States
Supreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing the
Florida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding.

Q: But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votes
counted by December 12.

A: They would have made it, but the five conservative justices stopped the
recount last Saturday.

Q: Why?

A: Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal.

Q: So why not separate the votes into piles, indentations for Gore, hanging
chads for Bush, votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or the
other so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won?
Then, if some ballots (say, indentations) have to be thrown out, the
American people will know right away who won Florida.

A. Great idea! The US Supreme Court rejected it. They held that such counts
would likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gore's winning
would cause ""public acceptance"" and that would ""cast[] a cloud"" over Bush's
""legitimacy"" that would harm ""democratic stability.""

Q: In other words, if America knows the truth that Gore won, they won't
accept the US Supreme Court overturning Gore's victory?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that a legal reason to stop recounts? or a political one?

A: Let's just say in all of American history and all of American law, this
reason has no basis in law. But that doesn't stop the five conservatives
from creating new law out of thin air.

Q: Aren't these conservative justices against judicial activism?

A: Yes, when liberal judges are perceived to have done it.

Q: Well, if the December 12 deadline is not binding, why not count the
votes?

A: The US Supreme Court, after admitting the December 12 deadline is not
binding, set December 12 as a binding deadline at 10 p.m. on December 12.

Q: Didn't the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court for
arbitrarily setting a deadline?

A: Yes.

Q: But, but --

A: Not to worry. The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it sets
for other courts.

Q: So who caused Florida to miss the December 12 deadline?

A: The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount, the
rent-a-mob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidating
officials, and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recount

Q: So who is punished for this behavior?

A: Gore, of course.

Q: Tell me this: Florida's laws are unconstitutional?

A: Yes

Q: And the laws of 50 states that allow votes to be cast or counted
differently are unconstitutional?

A: Yes. And 33 states have the ""clear intent of the voter"" standard that the
US Supreme Court found was illegal in Florida

Q: Then why aren't the results of 33 states thrown out?

A: Um. Because---um---..the Supreme Court doesn't say---

Q: But if Florida's certification includes counts expressly declared by the
US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, we don't know who really won the
election there, right?

A: Right. Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won
Florida by about 20,000 votes (excluding the butterfly ballot errors)

Q: So, what do we do, have a re-vote? throw out the entire state? count
under a single uniform standard?

A: No. We just don't count the votes that favor Gore.

Q: That's completely bizarre! That sounds like rank political favoritism!
Did the justices have any financial interest in the case?

A: Scalia's two sons are both lawyers working for Bush. Thomas's wife is
collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush
administration.

Q: Why didn't they recuse themselves?

A: If either had recused himself, the vote would be 4-4, and the Florida
Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed.

Q: I can't believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way.

A: Read the opinions for yourself:
http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/supremecourt/00-949_dec12.pdf (December 9
stay stopping the recount)
http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/00pdf/00-949.pdf (December 12
opinion)

Q: So what are the consequences of this?

A: The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our
Constitution (Al Gore) will lose to America's second choice who won the all
important 5-4 Supreme Court vote.

Q: I thought in a democracy, the guy with the most votes wins.

A: True, in a democracy. But America is not a democracy. In America in 2000,
the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins.

Q: So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President?

A: He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure
that the will of the people is less and less respected. Soon lawless
justices may constitute 6-3 or even 7-2 on the court.

Q: Is there any way to stop this?

A: YES. No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate. It
takes 60 votes to break a filibuster. If only 41 of the 50 Democratic
Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not
approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be
democratically elected in 2004, the judicial reign of terror can end....and
one day we can hope to return to the rule of law.

Q: What do I do now?

A: Email this to everyone you know, and write or call your senator,
reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes (three
times Kennedy's margin over Nixon) and that you believe that VOTERS rather
than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote.
And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people, you
want them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until 2004 when a president is finally
chosen by most of the American people.

Subject: Compound Model for Reedy Creek

Alex,

Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a 
couple of additional changes.

1.   The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike 
payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be 
discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values.
2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree 
approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature 
method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities.
3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for 
anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation 
since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.

Thanks,

Stinson

0,"Following up on our discussion yesterday, this is to summarize the issues and 
questions that we identified with respect to the trading of credit 
derivatives through Enron OnLine:

1.  The proposal needs to be analyzed more closely from the perspective of 
three principal regulatory schemes - securities, commodities and insurance.  
If the credit derivatives are not priced on the basis of or indexed to 
securities, there should not be any significant securities law issues.  With 
respect to the Commodity Exchange Act, if the derivatives are executed as 
swaps, they will need to satisfy the CFTC's swap exemption and, if executed 
as options, they will need to satisfy the trade option exemption.  With 
respect to insurance, there could be an issue as to whether the credit 
derivatives constitute insurance.  This determination as well will depend 
largely on how the derivatives are structured.  For example, how will payment 
amounts be determined and will payments be tied to losses actually 
experienced  by a counterparty?

2.  As a result of the foregoing, it will be necessary to obtain more details 
regarding the structure of the proposed transactions.  Will they be swaps or 
options?  What will the precise terms be (and are there any draft forms of 
confirms that can be reviewed)?

3.  It will also be necessary to determine how bankruptcy events will be 
defined.  This approach is clearly simpler than other forms of credit 
derivatives that include a variety of triggers (such as those based on 
defaults under loans, derivatives, securities or other instruments), because 
bankruptcy should generally be a public and objective event.  However, in 
many jurisdictions, it is  possible for third parties to cause an involuntary 
bankruptcy proceeding to be commenced and even frivolous proceedings can be 
commenced and maintained for some period.  Presumably the definition that is 
used will need to provide for some period in which the proceeding might be 
dismissed.  Also, the definition will need to take into account the 
possibility of non-US bankruptcy proceedings.

4.  We also should obtain more information on the manner in which the 
derivatives will be priced and the manner in which such prices will be 
published or disseminated to clients.  This goes to the issue of whether 
Enron could be found to have breached some duty to a third party or whether 
that party may have a claim against Enron on some other basis.

For example, it is possible that an entity whose ""name"" is included in the 
list of those on which derivatives are written will claim that Enron 
improperly used confidential information that it received about that party 
through a trading relationship in pricing derivatives on its credit.  In 
addition, such ""name"" might claim that Enron caused it injury by publishing a 
price for derivatives on its credit that reflected a weaker credit rating 
than was warranted.  That party might claim that, by publishing such price, 
Enron caused other parties to suspend trading with it, to declare defaults or 
to demand collateral.  This obviously is not generally a problem with credit 
derivatives because they are done privately on a one-to-one basis.

Please call us if you have any questions or would like to discuss these or 
other issues further.  Best regards.

Subject: FW: AP Report/Election Update






11/10/00
8:42am E.S.T.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Following an emergency meeting this morning, Congress
unanimously voted to eject Florida from the United States of America.

The move was a reaction to the confusion and irregularities in the state's
voting numbers that have totally disrupted the 2000 Presidential election.

""This is the last straw,"" said Utah senator Orin Hatch. ""First Elian
Gonzales,
now this.""

Several congressmen told reporters the decision has been a long time in
coming.

""We're all pretty much sick of Florida,"" said representative Barney Frank.
""They've been a constant embarrassment for too long now.""

Added Frank, ""They had Dan Marino for a while, but what have they done
lately?
Oh, that's right; screw up our entire democracy. I forgot.""

In a speech on the Senate floor, Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy
commented
that the loss of Florida's sizable elderly population will free up billions
of
dollars in Social Security funds.

""These are valuable funds which can now be redirected toward national
defense.
We can finally rebuild our demoralized, weakened military,"" said the Senator
to
roaring applause.

As a result of the Florida screw-up, the House and Senate decreed a new
election will take place in early December. This time, ballots in each state
will be tabulated by robots.

""It is clear that our human vote-counting system is too inherently flawed,""
said Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert. ""The presence of these new,
superior
robot mast- umm, I mean - tabulators will ensure 100% accuracy.""

""Remember,"" said Hastert, ""every vote counts, especially if it's counted by
robots.""

Dynamiting will begin in Florida next Wednesday, after which the state will
be
completely geographically separated from the United States.

""After that, they're on their own,"" said Hastert. ""I hope they sink.

0,"1. California AG Exploring Investigation of Power Profits

Sources report that the California Attorney General's office,in a meeting 
yesterday, ordered a review of the Federal Profiteering Statute.  In keeping 
with the recent 
rhetoric by Gov. Davis, this action is almost certainly directed toward 
investigations of profits made by generators and marketers.

2. More Detail on Bankruptcy- Creditors Concerned About Lengthy ""Cure Period""

The generators want to limit their exposure as general creditors in a Chapter 
11 proceeding. Their ability to their exposure depends on the ""cure period"" 
for 
making good on a defaulted payment, which would be dictated by the specific 
contract terms. If the ""cure period"" - that is, the time the utilities have 
available to
make up for missed payments before the generators or the power exchange can 
take them to court - is a short period of time, for the sake of argument 30
days, then the utilities' creditors have to swallow another 30 days of 
accumulated (impaired) receivables before they can move to the more
desirable position of postpetition suppliers (in which bills do get paid, as 
would be directed by the Bankruptcy Court judge). If, however, the utilities
have a longer ""cure period"", for the sake of argument 60 days, then their 
creditors will effectively have to swallow 60 days of accumulated impaired
receivables on which they will ultimately have to take a substantial haircut."

0,"Les Rawson has spoken with Doug Reiner at Willamette regarding this deal. 
They are in agreement now about the prices. Les said he usually has to 
explain the methodology a few times when he does deals with these guys, so 
it's nothing new. But in the future, Les said he'd prefer to contact the 
counterparty first to avoid confusion. His extension is 3924. You're also 
more than welcome to call me first and I'll track Les down. (I think I'm 
probably easier to get ahold of!) 

At any rate, I hope this clears it up. And if Willamette has any other 
questions, let me know.

Thanks,
Kate"

Justin,

ISO 9000 is a a type of standard which companies can seek to bring their 
corporations in line with and supposedly its a good thing to have. I attached 
an article from a website from which you can buy the standards. If you need 
more info let me know.
see ya later y'all

ISO9.com and ANSI Establish Reselling Agreement for the ISO 9000:2000 
Standards 
New York, NY and Oakland, CA, December 11, 2000 - ISO9.com and the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) have announced an agreement regarding 
U.S. distribution of the ISO 9000 series of quality management system 
standards, including the soon to be published ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9004:2000 
standards. ISO9.com sells electronic versions of the Standards on the 
Internet at http://store.iso9.com. The new version of ISO 9000 will be 
available on December 15.

""Distribution of the ISO 9000 standards is an important step for our 
organization,"" said Glenn Kohner, Founder and CTO of ISO9.com. ""Customers on 
the Internet expect instant delivery of information. Users on our site are 
learning about Internet ISO 9000. It's only natural that they would want 
access to the actual Standards.""

There are two ways to procure the ISO 9000 standards from ISO9.com. The 
Standards, which a company is required to own to be in compliance, will be 
offered both independently and bundled with the ISO9.com application. With 
the integrated version, companies will be able to view the Standard alongside 
their QMS, in a seamless format. 
""ISO9.com is one of ANSI's more unique value added resellers in that it has 
actually integrated the ISO 9001:2000 standard into its application,"" 
commented Bob Feghali, ANSI vice president of business development and chief 
information officer. ""We are committed to fast action in the delivery of the 
new ISO 9000 revisions; partnering with ISO9.com will greatly assist ANSI in 
our ability to insure a widespread distribution of the complete ISO 9000 
family of standards.""

Sergio Mazza, past President of ANSI, Appointed to Board of Directors

Oakland, CA. November 21, 2000 - ISO9.com, the world's first Application 
Service Provider to the ISO marketplace, announced the addition of Sergio 
Mazza to the Company's Board of Directors. Mr. Mazza served as the president 
of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) from 1993 through 1998. 
ANSI is a private, nonprofit membership organization supported by a diverse 
constituency of private and public sector organizations which has served as 
administrator and coordinator of private sector voluntary standardization 
systems in the United States for more than 80 years. As a member of the Board 
of Directors, Mr. Mazza will bring his depth of experience and knowledge in 
both international standards and high technology to help the Company achieve 
its corporate vision.

""We are truly excited to have Sergio Mazza join our team,"" said Fred 
Hornbacher, CEO of ISO9.com. ""He has tremendous depth of experience in our 
highly specialized field, and is uniquely qualified to help us bring our 
online vision for the quality and standards industries to fruition.""

Mr. Mazza's 21 years of proven leadership experience with high technology 
service businesses and his six years as the president of ANSI will both be 
instrumental in his new role with ISO9.com. His corporate career and 
leadership experience ranges from his activity as a software entrepreneur to 
his service as president of Memorex North America and Memorex Computer 
Supplies Worldwide. Mr. Mazza has recently been working as an advisor to 
online companies. He has extensive international experience, is fluent in 
four languages, and holds a BS degree in economics from the University of 
Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

**********************************************************************

This summer retail marketers have been confronted with extraordinarily 
difficult market circumstances for both gas and power. So far this summer, 
average weekly power prices have risen above $100 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 
several markets--almost double many of the standard offer levels. This 
differential between market prices and standard offers has made it almost 
impossible for retail marketers to offer customers an attractive service 
proposition in many areas of the United States open to competition. 
Similarly, in the gas market this summer (May through June) prices at the 
Henry Hub have averaged $3.92 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), well 
above the average of $2.62 per MMBtu during the same period last year. In 
some cases, the volatile gas and power markets this summer are proving lethal 
to retail marketers that chose to ride the spot markets rather than properly 
hedge their purchases and who lack the balance sheet strength to carry the 
burden. In addition, som!
e retail marketers have experienced difficulty with contract fulfillment by 
their wholesale suppliers, even when the retailer may have felt secure going 
into the summer. As a result of these market conditions, a few marketers have 
even relinquished their customers, returning them to the utilities who are 
the default suppliers.

Retail marketers serving these difficult markets (which include the West, 
PJM, and New England) are approaching the current situation with a number of 
different strategies, including

*  selling either part or all of their customer base

*  continuing to serve their existing customers but not renewing their 
contracts and planning to exit the market

*  turning customers back on utility service

*  continuing full steam ahead

The irony of this situation is that high prices over the next few years may 
actually help increase consumer awareness about competitive energy supplies 
and may even cause utilities under unrecoverable price cap rates to question 
whether they should remain in the merchant business. Uncertainties whether 
retail marketers can withstand these conditions and regulators and other 
interested parties will tolerate a sustained period of both high and volatile 
prices or if instead they will step in and adjust the rules in the name of 
protecting retail customers.

In this briefing CERA examines the question of whether one possible fallout 
from this summer's high and volatile energy prices will be increased 
consolidation among retail marketers, as retail customers (and/or businesses) 
begin to be actively bought and sold. We also examine the implications on 
retail markets of recent federal legislation supporting the legality of 
electronic contracts. In addition, we focus our first regional analysis on 
the regulatory developments and retail activity in the Northeast states and 
Canadian provinces--one of the most dynamic regions in terms of retail energy 
activity.

Retail Metrics

Trading Retail Customer Bases: Avenue for Building Market Share

Although the impact of volatile and high energy prices this summer may be 
bleak for many retail players, for a new entrant and/or contrarian buyer, 
this could be an excellent time to pick up customers ""on the cheap"" and build 
market share. In the past month there have been three notable cases of retail 
energy companies buying retail customer bases from other companies--in some 
cases just the retail customers have been purchased and in other cases whole 
retail energy businesses have been purchased. Examples include

*  North American market entry strategy. Centrica, an energy marketing 
business in the United Kingdom, purchased Direct Energy, an energy marketing 
business in Canada that also has a joint venture with Sempra called Energy 
America. Through its acquisition of Direct Energy, Centrica acquired 820,000 
Canadian gas customers and 27.5 percent ownership interest in Energy America, 
a US company that has 450,000 gas and power customers (see Table 1). In 
addition to gaining access to the largest retail customer base in North 
America, Centrica was able to buy a company with significant experience in 
various North American retail markets.

*  Gaining critical mass for an IPO. The New Power Company (a joint venture 
between Enron, IBM, and AOL) recently acquired over 300,000 gas and power 
customers from Columbia Energy Services as a way to quickly build market 
share before an initial public offering, for which a request has recently 
been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

*  Building market share. Energy America acquired 50,000 gas customers from 
Titan Energy, an energy marketer in Georgia, after the latter filed for 
bankruptcy.

In the two cases of bankruptcy, mass-market gas customers were purchased in 
the range of $44-$112 per customer. It appears that purchasing a base of 
retail customers is a cheaper form of buying market share than purchasing an 
entire company or division. For example, Centrica paid between $480 and $645 
per customer in its purchase of Direct Energy's business. This metric is 
somewhat misleading, however, as the purchase of Direct Energy also included 
upstream gas assets.

The three recent transactions join the list of retail customer acquisitions 
over the past year or two (see Table 1). These transactions are generally 
occurring for three common reasons: either as a result of a retail marketer 
bankruptcy (e.g., Titan Energy and Peachtree Gas), because companies are 
changing their strategic focus (e.g., NiSource/Columbia Energy and PG&E), or 
as a market entry tool (e.g., AES, Centrica, New Power). CERA expects many 
more players to consolidate and exit the business this year, particularly in 
the aftermath of the summer market.

The idea that the current climate might offer a good buying opportunity for 
retail customers has not been lost on the market. While existing retail 
markets are struggling to make ends meet, the number of marketers requesting 
certification has increased in some places such as Massachusetts, where it is 
expected these new entrants will attempt to purchase other marketers' 
businesses.

Table 1 shows extreme differences in prices paid for retail customer bases 
(on a total-cost-per-customer basis), since a wide variety of factors 
contribute to the cost of a customer and/or a retail business. CERA does not 
suggest that this table provides an apples-to-apples comparison on the cost 
of a customer. In terms of just pure customer acquisition costs there can be 
significant regional differences in the value of a customer owing to average 
use per customer and local market conditions. For example, a residential gas 
customer in Georgia will likely use far less gas than one in Michigan and 
should be valued differently as a result. Other factors such as buying 
habits, load size, existing contracts, and future potential growth in the 
market need to be evaluated to determine the proper valuation of customers. 
In addition, a myriad of factors can affect the value of a retail company, 
including what other capabilities, assets, and other factors are part of the 
deal, separat!
e from the customer base and underlying contracts.

Retail Market Share Consolidation Could Be the Trend over the Next Year

Although the buying and selling of retail customers through aggregators was a 
common feature of Ontario gas restructuring, this tactic has not been as 
prevalent in the United States for two reasons. Marketers have been 
distrustful of the methods of acquisition of other players and are therefore 
skeptical about the loyalty of customers if they were to be acquired through 
a purchase. Additionally, many have felt that they could acquire customers at 
a much lower cost than by purchasing an existing customer base.

This historical reluctance to buy retail customer bases seems to be changing, 
and will likely continue to change in the future. Over the past few years 
there has already been a maturation of many of these marketers and of the 
rules that they must obey. In addition, as larger name companies enter the 
retail markets, the risk associated with buying a customer base that had been 
acquired through questionable means has been drastically reduced.

With the emergence of significant players such as Enron, Centrica, and Shell 
into the retail market,  further customer buyouts will occur as these and 
other large players work to gain enough scale to make the retail business 
significant to their bottom line. The new breed of retail marketers may be 
better capitalized to play the short-run game of building market share as 
well as the long-run game. As a result, these players may be able to achieve 
scale in a market where no single company has achieved significant scale to 
date. In addition, many of these companies have strong wholesale marketing 
capabilities to support their retail marketing capabilities, inform their 
contracting practices, and help shield them from being on the wrong side of 
volatile markets.

Market Developments

New Law Removes the Wet Signature Barrier, but Lack of Uniform Rules Persists

The regulatory requirement for retail energy marketers to obtain written 
(""wet"") signatures from end users wanting to switch their energy service 
provider has posed a major cost barrier to marketers that already face high 
customer acquisition costs. As a result, a number of competitive energy 
marketers have exited markets with wet signature requirements. This cost 
barrier will be lowered in October when recently passed federal legislation 
takes effect--sparking renewed interest in the affected markets as well as 
guaranteeing that in the states scheduled to open, electronic customer 
sign-ups and transactions will be legally binding.

In late June, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Electronic 
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, which will take effect 
October 1, 2000. This law overrides state regulatory rulings and laws that 
have required wet signatures. However, although the news is a step forward 
for marketers, the issue is not entirely cut and dried.

*  The Act confirms the legality of electronic transactions, while giving the 
states broad authority on how to implement and judge requirements for these 
transactions.

*  It stipulates that parties engaged in transactions must both agree to 
conduct commerce electronically. This act neither mandates electronic 
commerce nor allows it to be mandated if not agreed to.

*  The Act follows on an earlier act titled the Uniform Electronic 
Transactions Act (UETA), which was proposed last year by the National 
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. For the states that 
adopted this earlier Act, the latest Congressional legislation allows them to 
adhere to the UETA. States that have not implemented the UETA will be under 
the jurisdiction of the new federal legislation, which is slightly more open 
to interpretation than the UETA.

What does this legislation mean at the state level? Unfortunately, this Act 
did not come in time to have a significant impact on the states that have 
troubled marketers (e.g., Arizona and New Jersey). Prior to the passing of 
this new legislation, Arizona adopted its own version of the UETA in April. 
Almost concurrent with the federal legislation, New Jersey recently approved 
an Internet pilot program to allow marketers to use electronic signatures to 
switch customers beginning in September. The program will be open to 350,000 
customers (10 percent of the market) and will last for six months before 
reevaluation by the Board of Public Utilities (BPU). However, in lieu of the 
federal legislation, the BPU will vote in August on lifting the program cap. 
It remains to be seen if either the pilot or new rules will be sufficient to 
lure back the marketers (e.g., KeySpan, DTE, Conectiv) that pulled out of New 
Jersey over the past year, citing the state's wet signature rules as one of!
 the primary reasons for their exit. Given the high use and ownship of 
personal computers in the residential market, as well as customer interest in 
being able to shop for suppliers over the Internet (about one third of 
customers surveyed in New Jersey supported Internet sign-up), we expect this 
recent ruling could jump-start marketing to the mass market this fall.

This legislation will have the most significant impact in states that have 
not opened to competition or ruled on wet signatures. Although benefiting all 
marketers by increasing their options, this Act benefits pure e-commerce 
players the most. The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be 
substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail 
(whose costs include paper and postage) or door-to-door sales (which involves 
high labor costs). Since many consumers will continue to remain without 
Internet service for the midterm, another implication of the ruling is that 
it will drive further customer segmentation by different types of marketers.

The implementation of the electronic signature law may signal the advent of 
the Internet as a favored marketing tool over the more traditional means of 
marketing to customer through paid advertising, direct mail, or door-to-door 
sales. Since the Act does not require states to accept oral communication as 
legally binding, many states will continue to require written or electronic 
signatures. ""Slamming"" and ""cramming"" remain the concern of many state 
regulators, resulting in rules that disallow oral transactions as a means of 
signing customers.

The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less 
than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail (whose costs include 
paper and postage) or door-to-door sales (which involve high labor costs). 
This will help divide the retail market into players serving different 
customer segments. One set will continue to acquire customers that do not 
have Internet access through traditional methods, whereas the other set of 
retail players will acquire and conduct business over the Internet, typically 
gaining higher income customers.

Though there can be little question that states will eventually have to allow 
marketers to transact and acquire customers over the Internet, the 
state-by-state rules governing electronic transactions are likely to continue 
to be nonstandard. Although the intent of the law as it is written is to 
nullify state wet signature legislation in all but a few cases, there could 
be some confusion over its interpretation at the state level. One area to 
watch will be how states interpret one of the law's few exceptions--that 
customers must be notified in a nonelectronic format when their utility 
service is being terminated. Some regulatory agencies may take that to mean 
that when consumers switch away from utility service, some form of 
communication must be sent to the consumer, and potentially a regulatory 
commission could require marketers to bear some or all of these costs.

Regional Analysis--Northeast Market

The attention being given to the high-priced summer market of 2000 is masking 
what could be seen as small steps forward for competition in the Northeast. 
Despite headlines about retail players exiting some markets and customers 
being returned to system supplies, state regulatory activity is proceeding 
apace this year, and there continues to be a steady influx of new players 
that are waiting for certification in states such as Massachusetts and New 
Jersey. Still, this has not been a banner year for retail activity in the 
Northeast (see Figure 1 and Table 2).

Regulatory Front

The region has more competitive retail power markets open than any other in 
the United States. Of the nine states in the Northeast, only New Hampshire 
and Vermont have not been opened to competition, although both states are 
moving forward to break the political impasse there. Maine and Connecticut 
have opened since January.

Although natural gas competition got off to an early start in the region, it 
now lags electric access, with only New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey 
technically open to gas competition to all customers. Over the next year, the 
only state that is expected to take any significant step forward on the gas 
front is Massachusetts, as the Department of Telecommunications and Energy 
(DTE) is likely to rule in favor of opening the market to all customers by 
the end of the year.

There has been a decrease in the number of customers in some utility 
jurisdictions that are competitively buying gas and power in the Northeast 
since March, particularly in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Since March the 
number of customers switched to retail marketers has dropped from 612,000 to 
547,000 for gas and increased somewhat for power from 680,000 customers to 
801,000. Although new competitors continue to petition for the right to serve 
in a number of northeastern states, in a few of the newly opened access 
states, retailers have been slow to step forward with competitive offers. 
This is particularly true for offers directed to residential and small 
commercial customers.

Wholesale Volatility

Market share of retail players in the Northeast has always remained highly 
fragmented, and utility affiliates retain the bulk of deregulated market 
share. This is poised to change over the next year, as some of the early 
retail marketers experiencing difficulty under the current market conditions 
pull back, leaving room for new entrants on the sidelines. In many of the 
states, wholesale prices this summer dramatically exceeded the level of 
competitive offers in the marketplace, exceeding $100 MWh in some cases in 
New England. A few retailers caught without a secure supply of wholesale 
power were forced to return their customers to the provider of last resort 
service. It will be important to watch these markets in the fall to see if 
customers return to these marketers and/or whether the regulators adjust the 
rules to prohibit this kind of behavior and/or fix the rules that perpetuate 
this discrepancy between the standard offer and market price.

Until the wave of new supply resources are built and brought online in these 
markets, high and volatile prices are likely to be a characteristic of this 
market. It remains to be seen if retailers will have learned the lessons from 
this past summer, however, and go into the next peak period with firm supply 
contracts as well as arm themselves with the marketing savvy to take 
advantage of customer aversion to high and fluctuating prices with offers of 
a stable price, while providing the marketer with a significant margin above 
the wholesale price.

The story is similar for gas, as CERA expects strong gas prices in the 
Northeast to continue for the new few years, until increased supply comes 
into the market. High prices will continue, owing to tight storage 
inventories and increased demand for gas for power generation, with last 
winter's volatility likely to be repeated in upcoming winters.

Canada

The largest Canadian market in the Northeast is Quebec, as Ontario will be 
covered as part of our Midwest regional analysis. The Quebec gas market is 
the only northeastern Canadian gas or power market fully open to competition. 
There is no investigation into power competition in Quebec at this time. It 
is likely that Quebec will wait and see how opening of the Ontario power 
market plays out next year before taking any action, just as it watched and 
repeated the Ontario gas market experience.

Greenfield gas distribution companies are being built in New Brunswick and 
Nova Scotia, which will be served by Sable Island gas supplies. The 
regulatory focus there is to encourage hooking customers up to gas system 
supplies, not necessarily to promote retail competition.

0,"Oops. My computer sent the message before I was finished.  I continue to hope 
that there is more opportunity than risk in this for us.  Price volatility is 
in the news like never before and our main product is price risk management.  
I know that the inquiries are up, I hope EES and ENA can get some sales out 
of it.  More utilities have been approaching TNPC, EES and ENA about taking 
over their merchant functions.  On the policy side, we are working the issue 
on both a state and federal level.  Whether this country does anything 
meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda 
Breathitt.  Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about 
proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC.  We are working the RTO process 
hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our 
remaining allies around the country.   THis is the biggest time for us on 
this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire.  In the 
current panic, however, we will be decimated if we are associated only with a 
move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona).  
I am going to read the comments next, but I start off thinking we need to 
avoid running headlong into the price cap movement; we may be better off 
trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.

Hang in there.

Grid Lock Our energy transport system is horrible. Just the way many 
utilities like it.
BY Daniel Fisher and Lynn Cook

06/11/2001
Forbes
080
Copyright 2001 Forbes Inc.

Our energy transport system is balkanized and horribly inefficient. 
Unfortunately, many of the incumbent utilities want to keep it that way. 
The Bush energy plan hits hard on increasing production. That alone won't 
solve the nation's power crunch. ""Supply is not the only issue,"" says 
Michelle Michot Soss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of 
Houston. ""The issue is bottlenecks.""
Some of these bottlenecks are political. A lot of them are created by 
incumbent utilities that do not welcome competition. 
Florida, for example, whose demand for electricity is growing at about 3.7% a 
year, is a net importer of energy. It generates around 24% of its power in 
aging oil-fired plants that should be replaced with more efficient 
combined-cycle generators. These burn natural gas in a turbine and use the 
hot exhaust gases to create steam, which spins a second turbine; they spew 
out less particulate and consume about a third less energy. 
So why doesn't Florida get efficient power plants? First, the state has only 
one main gas pipeline, though others are working their way through the 
regulatory process. More vexing is a state law, zealously defended by Florida 
utilities, that bans outside competitors from building combined-cycle plants 
larger than 75 megawatts--enough to juice 75,000 households--on the dubious 
theory that they waste water. Duke Energy tried to challenge the law with a 
500-megawatt plant in New Smyrna Beach. FPL Corp. (parent of Florida Power & 
Light) fought the plant all the way to the Florida Supreme Court and won. 
Florida's screwy power-plant law is just one example of the byzantine 
regulations that stymie efforts to make the nation's energy grid more 
efficient and prices more competitive. From laws that protect utilities 
against more efficient rivals to outdated state regulations that discourage 
the construction of transmission lines, these choke points either waste 
energy or make it impossible for energy to get where it should go. 
A series of state laws in the 1920s laid down the monopolies on grids. They 
were codified in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, a populist 
law that identified bigness with badness in the electricity business: To 
avoid federal scrutiny and regulation, most utilities decided not to operate 
outside their own state boundaries; rate setting fell to the states. But even 
as wholesale electricity markets have been deregulated, utilities can still 
bat away outsiders by reserving their own transmission lines for ""native 
load."" This allows them to keep an open lane on the energy highway, as it 
were, to rush electricity to certain customers when their demand suddenly 
spikes. 
In such areas as the Southeast, the owner of a transmission line has a pretty 
free hand in calculating what its native load is. So Southern Co., which owns 
utilities in Georgia and four neighboring states, can determine how much 
power to let into its territory. 
Southern Co. defends the rule, saying its primary job is ensuring customers 
get all the power they need. ""The marketers would like to schedule another 
10,000 megawatts of power to go across our lines tomorrow,"" says William 
Newman, a senior vice president. ""It's not going to happen. The system wasn't 
designed for it."" 
Enron disagrees. Utilization of its natural gas pipeline system increased 50% 
in the five years after the gas market was deregulated. Steven Kean, head of 
government regulations at the Houston-based giant, thinks similar gains are 
possible in electricity if companies like Southern are forced to hand over 
control of the grid to independent regional boards that will determine how to 
allocate power flows and where to build new lines. The utilities ""don't want 
to accept the economically pure solution,"" he says. ""Once utilities have been 
adequately compensated for their stranded costs, then it's time for them to 
shut up, sit in the corner and let the economists and lawyers work out the 
details."" 
Lawyers and economists making decisions for us? That doesn't sound like 
deregulation. But there is a case to be made for separating control of power 
lines from control of other utility assets. Phillip G. Harris is chief 
executive of PJM (it stood for Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland), a regional 
power line organization. Since this independent system operator was formed in 
April 1997 and six local utilities ceded control over transmission lines, 
reliability has gone up and prices down, he says. Where Southern Co. will 
only add transmission capacity if it has a firm contract in hand, PJM can 
order lines to be built. Its member companies are spending $311 million over 
the next three years on new lines to increase the flow from power-rich to 
energy-poor areas. 
Last May temperatures hit the highest levels since 1930 at the same time as 
15,000 megawatts of PJM's 59,000 megawatts were out of service for 
maintenance. As the peak load rose to 51,000 megawatts--7,000 more than was 
available within PJM--power streamed in over a dozen entry points. Prices 
topped out at $432 a megawatt hour. That's about four times what you are 
probably paying for residential service, but it stands in contrast to spikes 
in the thousands of dollars in California and the Midwest during similar 
crises. 
Unfortunately, what works inside PJM doesn't transfer to Los Angeles, much 
less to Manhattan. Different rules regarding electricity transactions and a 
shortage of transmission lines make it difficult to export electricity across 
the Hudson River. When Hydro-Quebec tried to build a power line across Long 
Island Sound in 1999, Connecticut nixed the idea. Ostensible reason: the 
possibility of harm to oyster beds. Real reason: Folks in New Haven asked, 
what's in it for us--and didn't see any clear benefit to them. There is, 
unfortunately, no mechanism for buying off losers in these deals, such as 
property owners near, but not under, the power line. So they hire lawyers and 
talk solemnly about oysters. 
California's bottleneck is on Path 15, a 500,000-volt transmission line that 
links the northern and southern halves of the state. Path 15 can't 
accommodate the flows of power needed when the weather is cool in San 
Francisco and hot in L.A. But the legal and financial chaos in California, 
with the state on the verge of taking over much of the transmission system, 
discourages investors from backing an increase in capacity. ""If we put in 
good rules on how to operate transmission systems, you would see investment,"" 
says Lawrence Makovich, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
""The problem is right now there is no such plan."" 
Enron is trying to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take 
charge, so far to little avail. In a case pending before the U.S. Supreme 
Court, Enron accuses FERC of abdicating its responsibility to do for 
interstate trading of electricity what it did for trading of gas. 
But forcing FERC down that path will be difficult. Natural gas producers 
needed interstate pipelines to get to big markets in the North, which needed 
the gas. But incumbent (and politically connected) electric companies have no 
such incentive to stimulate a national market in electricity. ""There's not a 
single incentive in the entire U.S. to relieve congestion,"" states Jeanine 
Hull, president of Strategic Energy Advisors and a former power-company 
lawyer. ""Ask yourself this question: If you had a chance today to retain your 
monopoly or compete, which would you choose?""

US Sen. Feinstein Urges Hearings On FERC 'Improprieties'

05/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called Friday 
for Senate hearings to investigate ""possible improprieties"" involving the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's relations with the industry it 
regulates. 
""Despite evidence of manipulation and price gouging in both the electricity 
and natural gas markets in California and the West, and a finding by FERC 
last November of 'unjust and unreasonable' (electricity) rates, the 
commission has failed to take the actions necessary to bring reliability and 
stability to the marketplace,"" Feinstein said in a letter to Sen. Joe 
Lieberman, D-Conn., seeking hearings by the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee.
Feinstein cited a report in The New York Times Friday in which FERC Chairman 
Curt Hebert related a phone conversation with Ken Lay, chairman of Enron 
Corp. (ENE). Hebert alleged that Lay offered to bring his influence to bear 
with the Bush administration to maintain Hebert as chairman if the regulator 
would adopt policy positions favored by Enron. 
Hebert is quoted as saying he was ""offended"" by the conversation. Lay 
disputed Hebert's account. 
The Times article also quoted Vice President Dick Cheney as saying Texas 
utility regulator Pat Wood has ""got to be the next chairman of the FERC"" to 
address problems in electricity markets. Cheney's remark is slated for 
broadcast by the public television program ""Frontline."" 
""While Mr. Lay's account (of the conversation) differs, it is clear that the 
citizens of the United States, especially the people of California, who are 
suffering from FERC's failure to do its job, deserve an investigation and 
full public hearing into what happened,"" Feinstein said in the letter to 
Lieberman. 
""FERC is a $175 million-a-year agency charged with regulating the energy 
industry, and it would be unconscionable if any of the nation's electricity 
traders or generators were in a position to be able to determine who chairs 
or becomes a member of the commission,"" Feinstein wrote. 
""Since FERC has refused to fulfill its legally mandated function under the 
Federal Power Act to restore 'just and reasonable' electricity rates, we need 
to ask whether undue influence by the companies that FERC regulates has 
resulted in its failure to act,"" the letter said. 
Feinstein seeks a broad investigation into FERC, and not just an airing of 
the Lay-Hebert exchange, which Feinstein said she sees as an example of ""a 
definite problem,"" the senator's spokesman, Howard Gantman, said. 
""There are very close relationships between FERC and the industry it 
regulates. Some of those relationships could be improper,"" Gantman said. 
Lieberman, who has requested that the General Accounting Office investigate 
FERC's response to the California electricity crisis, will become chairman of 
the Governmental Affairs Committee when Democrats assume the Senate majority 
in about two weeks. 
There was no immediate response from Lieberman's office regarding Feinstein's 
letter.

U.S. Physical Gas Cash Prices Fall; No Load Weekend

05/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Friday ahead of a 
no-load holiday weekend, widening considerably the differential to the New 
York Mercantile Exchange futures board. 
Traders saw storage buying providing the only hint of demand.
Also, several pipelines in Texas, along with El Paso's Tennessee Gas and PG&E 
Citygate, held system-wide operational flow orders on the high inventory 
resulting from storage. Those orders also sent prices downward, traders said. 
Demand remains slight with only hints of sustained hot weather sighted in the 
next two weeks,traders said. 
With few demand fundamentals in place, traders saw few utilities in the 
market. 
The Nymex June futures contract settled at $3.973/MMBtu, down 8.1 cents, the 
first time the front contract has fallen below $4/MMBtu in nearly 10 months. 
Traders pointed to 17,000 option puts at $4/MMBtu supporting the June 
contract. Options expired Friday; the June contract expires Tuesday after the 
Memorial Day weekend. Traders expect a $3.80-$4/MMBtu range on Tuesday for 
expiration. 
Also, Enron Online will keep its trading boards open for the holiday. 
Prices for the June contract are in the same range as they were a year ago, 
when driving heat and competition for gas during May pushed prices upward. 
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, prices were in a 
$3.76-$3.90/MMBtu range, down 25 cents-35 cents. 
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done at 
$3.82-$3.94/MMBtu, down 25 cents-32 cents. 
At the Arizona-California border, El Paso's prices fell $1.40-$2.55/MMBtu to 
a $9.80-$11.50 closing range. Western electricity prices weakened again 
Friday for the holiday, and traders said pipelines into California were 
showing high inventories. 
At the PG&E Citygate, prices fell $4.25-$5.50 to a $3.90-$4.40/MMBtu closing 
range on the reported operational flow order. 
Buyers paid $3.74-$3.90/MMBtu at the Katy hub in East Texas, down 23 cents-32 
cents. At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $3.59-$3.75, down 30 cents-39 
cents.

FOCUS Brazil real to remain pressured due to energy crisis/political concerns

05/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

SAO PAULO (AFX) - The real is likely to remain under pressure in the 
short-to-medium term due to concerns about the impact of the energy shortage 
crisis on the economy and ongoing political worries, analysts said. 
They said the energy shortage problems are scaring away direct foreign 
investment, while political concerns ahead of the presidential elections next 
year are expected to come much more to the forefront once the Argentine debt 
swap operation is completed at the start of next month.
The real was at 2.3480 against the dollar in afternoon trade, down about 20 
pct from the end of last year. 
Analysts said the weakness of the real combined with a generally-accepted 
slowdown in GDP growth as a result of the energy crisis has complicated the 
task of the central bank's monetary policy committee Copom. 
The Copom raised its base interbank Selic rate to 16.75 pct from 16.25 pct 
earlier this week, in what was regarded by many analysts as a preventive move 
against the inflationary impact of the real's depreciation. 
In a recent report, Banco Santander Central Hispano SA said it has revised 
its forecast for Brazil's 2001 GDP growth to 2.2 pct from 4.1 pct previously 
due to the possible impact of the government's energy rationing plan. 
BSCH said it is also cutting its 2002 GDP growth estimate to 3.0 pct from 4.5 
pct previously. 
BSCH also revised its forecast for the real's level against the dollar to 
2.30 by end-2001 from 2.13. 
""Argentina's problems and their effects on the flow of capital to Brazil... 
added to energy rationing and stronger perceptions of political risk hinder a 
significant appreciation of the real, although we consider a possible gradual 
solution to the Argentine crisis,"" BSCH said. 
Analysts said central bank intervention yesterday and today in the foreign 
currency market in an effort to stem the real's depreciation is clear 
evidence of the central bank's concerns about the local unit. 
The central bank today sold 2.0 mln dollar linked-bonds maturing on March 14, 
2002 after selling 1.0 mln dollar-linked bonds yesterday. 
""We don't know how far the real will go. Everything points to a situation in 
which the dollar will move to the 2.45 level against the real in the short 
term and never return to the 2.0 level it was at at the start of the year,"" 
Brazilian Institute of the Economy (IBRE) director Renier Garcma said. 
Direct foreign investment has slowed down this year as a result of the 
concerns surrounding Brazil. 
The government has already revised its estimate of direct foreign investment 
in Brazil this year to 19 bln usd from 24 bln previously. Direct foreign 
investment in the four months to April was 6.6 bln usd, about half the levels 
posted a year earlier. 
Enron Corp recently suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the Brazilian 
energy sector, citing regulatory concerns, while the government decided to 
postpone indefinitely the privatisation of Cia Energetica earlier this month 
due to the energy crisis. 
The minimum price for the sale of Cesp Parana was set at 1.7 bln reals, with 
a number of foreign companies lined up to bid. 
""Investors are shying away from carrying out operations in the country. The 
energy crisis has had a disastrous impact on Brazil's image; the country risk 
has risen and companies are opting for saver markets,"" IBRE's Garcma said. 
Analysts said the energy crisis has strongly affected the image of President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and has therefore strengthened the opposition's 
position ahead of next year's presidential elections. 
They said corruption allegations involving former and current senior 
officials in the government and the alleged breach of vote secrecy rules at 
the Senate resulting in proceedings for the dismissal of former Senate 
chairman Antonio Carlos Magalhaes and senator Jose Roberto Arruda have 
complicated the political scenario. 
Yesterday, Senator Arruda resigned from the Senate, while a local TV news 
channel reported Magalhaes will resign next week and attack Cardoso. 
""The government seems to have lost direction,"" one analyst said. 
Earlier this month, Congress rejected a petition presented by the left-wing 
Workers Party (PT) to set up a joint Congress-Senate commission to 
investigate corruption in the private and public sectors after 20 
parliamentarians belonging to parties within the ruling coalition withdrew 
their support for the motion. 
Opposition deputy Aloizio Mercadante at the time said the PT was preparing 
legal action against the government and the deputies who withdrew their 
support for the petition, alleging they were offered financial incentives to 
do so. 
Analysts said fears remain that the opposition will attempt to revive the 
corruption commission issue, further complicating the governability of the 
country in an already delicate moment.

Vice Pres Cheney Sees Wood As New FERC Chairman - NYT

05/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Vice President Richard Cheney expects Texas Public 
Utilities Commission Chairman Pat Wood to become chairman of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, according to Friday's New York Times. 
In an interview for an upcoming episode of the PBS series Frontline, Cheney 
says, ""Pat Wood's got to be the new chairman of the FERC, and he'll have to 
address"" various problems in electricity markets, according to the Times 
article, part of a joint effort with the Frontline program.
The article says current Republican FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert received a 
call from Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman Kenneth Lay this year prodding him to 
back a national push for retail electricity competition and faster access to 
the power transmission grid in exchange for Enron's support of Hebert in his 
new job. 
It quotes Hebert as saying, ""I was offended."" 
Lay, one of President George W. Bush's largest campaign contributors, 
provided the White House with a list of preferred candidates for FERC posts 
and had access to the White House energy policy task force chaired by Cheney, 
the article says. 
Wednesday the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved Wood and 
Nora Brownwell of the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, Bush's 
nominees to fill two empty seats on FERC's five-member board. The full Senate 
has yet to approve them. 
It would be up to the president whether to replace Hebert as chairman. In the 
Times article, Hebert said no one has told him he would be replaced.

INDIA: Enron's woes make Indian power firms anxious.
By Himangshu Watts

05/25/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, May 25 (Reuters) - India's private power producers demanded on 
Friday that the federal government intervene in Enron Corp's bitter row with 
a local utility and state clearly if it wants the U.S. energy giant to stay 
in India or quit. 
""The government needs to decide whether we want Enron or not. In case they 
don't want Enron, they should spell out the reasons for it,"" Harry Dhaul, 
director-general of the Independent Power Producers' Association of India, 
told Reuters.
But Federal Power Secretary A.K. Basu said Enron and the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board (MSEB) had to resolve their differences over the $2.9 
billion project themselves. 
""Basically the Maharashtra government and Dabhol have to sort it out,"" Basu 
told reporters after a meeting with Wade Cline, the chief executive officer 
of Enron India. 
Basu stuck to the federal government's stand that it would help implement any 
proposal emerging from negotiations between the Dabhol Power Co, 65-percent 
owned by Enron, and the MSEB. 
Dhaul said the fate of Dabhol, India's largest direct foreign investment and 
biggest power project, would determine the future of domestic and foreign 
private investment in power and other infrastructure projects. 
""It is an important issue. It is a benchmark for all future infrastructure 
investments of $1 billion plus."" 
On Thursday, Enron said the MSEB cancelled a disputed power-buying contract 
just five days after the Houston-based energy firm moved to pull out of the 
project. 
WANT PRO-ACTIVE APPROACH 
Dhaul said the federal government should intervene in the dispute between 
Enron and the utility. ""We want a pro-active approach in supporting 
independent power producers."" 
Basu said the government had advised Enron to thrash out the matter with the 
negotiation committee set up by the Maharashtra government. The committee is 
due to meet on May 29. 
Cline refused to answer questions from reporters and only said the company 
would not renegotiate the power-buying contract on the basis of a committee 
set up by the state government. 
""We won't renegotiate on the basis of the Godbole Committee report,"" he said. 
The committee, chaired by a former bureaucrat Madhavrao Godbole, has 
suggested that the tariff be re-negotiated to make it cheaper and to remove 
the dollar linkage which resulted in a steep increase each time the rupee 
fell against the dollar. 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to it charging 7.1 rupees per kilowatt hour versus 1.5 rupees 
charged by other suppliers. 
Dabhol Power Co is building India's largest power plant with a total capacity 
of 2,184 MW. 
The first phase of the $2.9-billion project with a capacity of 740 MW began 
operating in May 1999. The second phase that will add 1,444 MW of capacity, 
is expected to be completed this year.

Enron Unit's Sales, Costs Rise With Power Prices, Paper Says
2001-05-25 13:00 (New York)


     Portland, Oregon, May 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s
Portland General Electric reported first-quarter earnings rose
10 percent as high electricity prices pushed up both sales and
costs for the Oregon power producer, the Oregonian reported.
     The company earned $43 million, the paper said. Revenue from
wholesale power sales was $480 million, three times the year-
earlier period, even as costs to buy electricity almost doubled.
     PGE's power plants produce less than half the electricity
needed to supply its 728,000 Oregon customers, forcing the company
to buy power on the same markets into which it sells, the paper
said. Dry weather is cutting hydropower resources, and easing
wholesale prices could make it more difficult for the company to
profit from power sales outside the state, the paper said.
     Edison International's Southern California Edison, which has
filed for bankruptcy, and two California agencies, one of which is
now defunct, owe the company $128 million, the paper said. The
company is pursuing collection, the paper said, citing Chief
Financial Officer James Piro.



India Enron Panel Lacks Authority to Solve Dispute, Expert Says
2001-05-25 07:16 (New York)

India Enron Panel Lacks Authority to Solve Dispute, Expert Says

     Mumbai, May 25 (Bloomberg) -- Indian negotiators lack the
authority to solve a dispute that has shut down Enron Corp.'s $3
billion power plant, India's single biggest foreign investment,
said a former member of the negotiating committee.
     The negotiators will meet Enron officials on Tuesday next
week, though any proposals made will not be binding on either
Dabhol Power Co., 65 percent owned by Enron, and the Maharashtra
State Electricity Board, the official said. Maharashtra, Dabhol's
sole customer, has refused to pay some of its power bills.
     ``Where is the guarantee Enron and the government will accept
what the committee recommends,'' said R.K. Pachauri, director-
general at the Tata Energy Research Institute, a research
organization. Pachauri said he quit the committee because it was
being asked to renegotiate the project, when it was set up to
solve the payment dispute.
     Maharashtra yesterday served Dabhol notice canceling the
power purchase contract, six days after Dabhol gave the board
notice it was set to pull out of the project in six months.
     The board has refused to pay Dabhol 3 billion rupees for
power supplied in December and January, saying the bills should
reflect a 4 billion rupee penalty it imposed on the company Jan.
28 for failing to supply power at full capacity.

                            Meeting

     Other India officials said the two parties can't afford not
to negotiate as there is too much at stake.
     Mahrashtra and Dabhol serving each other notices is ``simply
legal maneuvering,'' said Kirit Parikh, an economist on the prime
minister's economic advisory council.
     ``It won't affect the process of finding a solution because
``the ground reality is neither Enron nor Maharashtra can afford
not to find a compromise'' to the dispute, Parikh said.
     The government needs a solution as it could be left footing
the bill.
     India's federal and state governments, which have guaranteed
the board's payments for power and some of the loans to help fund
the project, may have to pay Dabhol more than 170 billion rupees
($3.6 billion) if it terminates the 2,184 megawatt power project.
     ``We are going back to Maharashtra tomorrow to work on the
problem.'' Dabhol managing director Wade Cline said. Cline was in
New Delhi to meet A. K. Basu, secretary to the ministry of power."

>
>While the proposed order is not as clear and unambiguous as I would

>surely prove to be a vigorous court fight.
>
>Your unambiguous declaration that the rates being charged in the
>wholesale market are, and have been, ""unjust and unreasonable"", would
>have restored credibility to the wholesale market. But your action is
>more than adequate for the California Public Utilities Commission to
>deny the applicability of the filed rate doctrine to the wholesale
>prices produced by a FERC-approved tariff, which FERC has now ruled
>failed to produce ""just and reasonable"" rates.
>
>For California consumers, it means that there is now a legal
>justification for these unjust wholesale costs to not be passed on to
>the retail ratepayers.  In turn, the State and consumers should
>support utilities in litigating for relief against those parties who
>profited from ""unjust and unreasonable"" wholesale rates which, of
>course, will likely require action against FERC itself.
>
>As I have indicated in prior correspondence, we disagree with your
>counsel's opinion that you are constrained from acting retroactively.
>If the tariffs produced ""unjust and unreasonable rates"" and were,
>therefore, illegal in October, they were similarly illegal in prior
>months in which the effect of market power was even more evident.
>
>However, we appreciate both your stated desire to act retroactively
>and your request to Congress to clarify this authority. While we would
>certainly prefer that Congress act on your request, we are also
>confident that the Federal Court will confirm our legal analysis.  In
>the interim, your invitation to California to suggest equitable
>remedies for earlier periods, is most welcome.  As a threshold matter,
>a statement by you of your intention to host a settlement conference
>in San Diego would be most useful in moving such a remedy forward.
>
>I support your present proposals to restructure the previously
>FERC-approved tariffs to address the ability of parties to exercise
>market power as far as they go.  However, I do have concerns that
>enhancing the ability of California utilities to make forward
>purchases will not mitigate market power.  Since forward contracts
>will be based upon sellers expectations regarding real- time markets
>and since real-time market prices will still be distorted by the
>exercise of market power, forward contract prices will themselves be
>distorted.
> 
>Finally, I will take particular satisfaction in the conversion of the

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

 Jim,

 This will confirm our telephone conference about this matter, in light of 
Underwriters' recent response to our claim.  You will ask Underwriters' 
adjuster for permission for our chemist to speak directly with their chemist 
immediately about the facts.  You will also ask for a meeting to be set up 
for you, our broker, and Underwriters' adjuster to see whether Underwriters 
mean to take a hard line on our claim.

 Interestingly, Underwriters' position seems to be, at least preliminarily, 
and subject to further comment by their chemists, that nothing was wrong with 
our cargo or the ship; the cargo was simply misdescribed as turbine 
fuel-grade condensate by SGS due to flawed testing by SGS at loadport, when 
it was in fact nothing better than crude. Meanwhile, we all noted that 
Underwriters' adjuster included the following statement in her report:  ""It 
has not been demonstrated that the oil suffered from inherent vice.""  I am 
both pleased and surprised that this was included in Underwriters' report, 
and share David's feeling that the adjuster probably inadvertantly copied 
this from a confidential report from her chemist.  If we can successfully 
hammer at Underwriters' preliminary theory, Underwriters will find it more 
difficult to fall back on an inherent vice defense.

 I await further word from you.  Many thanks for your help.

Subject: AGENCY.COM Presentation at BEA Users Conference

Here is the information regarding the presentation done by AGENCY.COM.

The BEA Users Conference is being held in San Francisco, CA 2/21-2/24.
The conference has over 2,000 registered users representing many types of 
companies.
About the Session and Presentation
On Wednesday, February 23 at 11:00 an hour long session was to open to any 
registered conference attendee.
Around 200 (very rough guess) people attended the session.
The session was moderated by Scott Dietzen, CTO BEA Server Division and was 
described as 
'Web E-Commerce Solutions: Using Best of Breed Technologies'.
The session included 4 panel members from Calico Commerce (an ISV), Idea 
Integration 
(an integrator), Cygent (an ISV) and AGENCY.COM.
Each of the 4 panel members gave a 12 minute presentation then the session 
was turned over
for general questions and answers.
Joe Tatem of AGENCY.COM went last and spoke about the web development 
marketplace: where 
it was and where it needed to head.
Like the other panel members he described his company and gave a little sales 
pitch for 
BEA Weblogic.
Tatem then presented a case study as an example of some of their work.
This example was of AGENCY.COM's work for Enron on EnronOnline.
His case study consisted of 2 slides.
The first slide had screen images of EnronOnline: one was the EnronOnline 
home page and the 
second was the quotes page populated with some products.
The quotes page was 'overlayed' on the home page and obscured the EnronOnline 
banner on the 
bottom so that only the 'ne' at the end showed.
The Enron logo (the counter-clockwise 45-degree logo was clearly visible. 
He talked about it being a Trading Extranet site but said he could not name 
the customer.
He described that real time prices for products were being displayed to 
customers.
He then showed the next slide which gave a high level overview of the 
application 
architecture for EnronOnline.
This slide contains details about real time server (RTServer) and its 
associated 
application server (including the RMI communication mechanism).
He made a comment about how they were particularly proud of the real time 
piece and how it 
was designed and how it worked.
This slide also contained a reference to the fact EnronOnline uses Oracle 8i.
He also mentioned Jesica as the content management piece and indicated that 
they were 
looking at other 3rd party products to replace that in their future projects.
This slide also contains a reference to StackManager and he indicated that it 
was developed 
by the unamed client and not by AGENCY.COM.
He also talked about ShockWave plugin being used in the browser to receive 
the 
real time quotes.
Only one question was asked from the audience during his showing of the 
technical 
architecture slide.
This question (paraphrased) was: When you use RMI between the web server and 
the 
app server how many connections do you use.
He replied (paraphrased): one per thread.
The questioner then asked something else that I assumed was a technical 
detail about how 
WebLogic RMI worked.
Tatem replied incorrectly and a BEA employee responded with the right answer.
About the Handouts of the Presentation
BEA tried to make available hard copies of all presentation slides in each 
session.
They setup a series of shelves that were numbered for each session.
The documents were available starting Monday during the registration process 
and 
throughout the conference.
On Monday evening I went to pick up hard copies of the sessions for which I 
was interested.
About a third of the handouts for the sessions were not available.
I did not notice whether the one for above mentioned presentation was 
available. (I did 
not expect it to one of the more interested ones.)
During some of the sessions BEA handed out copies to those present.
I did not see any handed out during the above mentioned session.
After the session was over I called Jay Webb and told him of the above 
details.
After telling Jay I saw Scott Dietzen from BEA in the hallway. (I had met him 
twice before.)
I told Dietzen that the presentation that AGENCY.COM did in his panel was 
about Enron. 
(We had already discussed the project with Dietzen when he visited our 
Houston office.)
I told him that AGENCY.COM was not supposed to reveal any information 
concerning the 
project.
At this time I did not know that hard copies of the presentation were 
available. I told 
Dietzen that if they did become available that the portion about EnronOnline 
should not 
be distributed.
Dietzen said he was not aware of the problem with discussing the project. He 
apologized 
and said he would not distribute any handouts if he received them.
Sometime later on Wednesday I went to the rack of presentation handouts and 
there was 
one available for the above mentioned session.
I do not know how long they were available (and I don't think Dietzen did 
either).
There were only 2 or 3 copies left and I took all of them. (BEA usually put 
out many 
copies in the rack so I don't know how many were actually picked up.)
The hard copies are PowerPoint printouts that include room for notes so the 
slides are 
very small making it difficult to read.
When the slides were shown on the screen during the session they were very 
clear.

Also, during some of the sessions (not the one where AGENCY.COM presented) I 
attended 
there was some question about the availability of the handouts and someone 
from BEA would 
answer something about the web.
I assumed that at some point in the near future they might be making copies 
of the 
presentations available on the BEA web site.
I will try to confirm this tomorrow (Thursday).
I checked the web site a few minutes ago and the presentations are not there. 

I will followup with any more details if I remember something else or if 
there are any 
further developments.

Thanks,
Kevin Montagne

Subject:	PSW Day 2

Good Afternoon,

Here is my Laundry list for today:

My saved sheet does not save all of my criteria selections in build route.  When I re-open, I have to select the day of week mask filtering and report changes again.  It is defaulted to checked in the new sheet, but erases upon saving and reopening.
Fixed - Saved sheet will save all the selection criteria.

I also do not see where to find the changes to existing deals that I want to see reported.  How do I get to those?  In the original build route, it was a second tab in the excel sheet.  
You can see deal changes in Log tab, next to Route Data tab.

Routing does not show an OK on rows with the sched term of ""BOM"", but it does route them.
The workspace error log gave the following error on these rows of ""No Supply Data available for Term Routing.  Just have BOM equal Day in the logic of routing.


The workspace error log does not pop to the front of all active applications, nor does it have a space on the tool bar.  I thought the sheet was frozen again, and started minimizing applications until it suddenly popped up. Just clicking on the PSW does not bring the workspace error log to the front.



One problem with many other problems imbedded in it.

The Global ID column needs to be able to hold up to 30 characters, I had numerous rows with the notation ""IDACCISO0010 and SRP_WESC101P_CISO"" . 
Increased the Column Size to 50 in Stage, Will do the same changes in Production as soon as Production Freez ends.
 
This gave me an error ""General SQL error. ORA_01401: inserted value too large for column, but error check did not say anything. When I changed the cells and re-saved, I got the same message again, as if the rows are permanently embedded with these values.   I had to delete the rows and re-paste them in from the sheet to get them to work.  This would have been problematic had I not had my working sheet in Excel.

The rows that had this notation were not sent to Path Confirmation, but were changed from X to R in the PSW.
These are routed but, path is not confirmed. 


Please call me if these explanations do not make sense, I will be happy to explain myself further.

Thanks,

0,"Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketing Working Group

FROM: Donald Santa, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Joe Hartsoe, Power Marketing Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: August 30, 2000

RE: California ""Fact Sheet""

At our meetings last week with FERC, we had a great deal of valuable factual 
information and policy suggestions, but they were not pulled together as a 
cohesive story.  Based on materials provided by various companies, we have 
drafted the attached fact sheet entitled ""California: The Real Story.""  It is 
an effort to pull together the most compelling pieces of information and 
policy arguments as a ""leave-behind"" for FERC staff and other regulators and 
to form the basis for any testimony at the upcoming congressional hearings.

The paper includes factual information pulled from a number of sources and 
Jackie Gallagher, EPSA's Research Assistant, is attempting to verify and cite 
as many facts as possible.  To make the message convincing, we need ""chapter 
and verse"" on our facts.  Please review the material carefully to be sure it 
is accurate and compelling.  Any assistance in verifying these facts, or 
providing others that do a better job of telling our story, will be 
appreciated.  You can e-mail to Jackie at jgallagher@epsa.org.

We will discuss the paper during our conference call next Wednesday, 
September 6 at 11:00 a.m. (EDT).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and 
ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.  If you have any questions or suggestions 
before Wednesday, please contact Julie Simon at 202-789-7200.

Drop in Natural-Gas Prices May Be Good For Consumers but Hinder New Production
By Alexei Barrionuevo
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

In the wake of last month's terrorist attacks, natural-gas prices have slid below $2 per million British thermal units, frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural-gas projects. 
Analysts predict that with prices at current levels, projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the U.S. could be shelved or canceled.
Natural-gas prices, which reached highs of nearly $10 per million BTUs last December, had held to around $3 to $5 per million BTUs for much of the year. At $2 per million BTUs and below, producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production. 
Analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand, fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric-utility demand. Nearby November futures fell 36 cents yesterday to $2.208 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
In the Boston area, however, different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region. Last week, the U.S. Coast Guard, under pressure from local lawmakers, indefinitely banned LNG tankers from entering Boston Harbor. LNG makes up 15% of New England's gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days. The Coast Guard and Department of Transportation are studying concerns that a LNG tanker could become a bomb for terrorists. 
Already, relative to other areas, natural-gas prices have inched higher in New England, where natural-gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market. The spread between prices in New England and the Gulf Coast widened last week by 30 cents to $1.30 per million BTUs, said a spokeswoman for Distrigas, a unit of Belgium's Tractebel SA. But the lack of LNG isn't likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural-gas storage is used up. 
Richard Grant, CEO of Distrigas, says LNG has a 30-year safety record at the company's Everett, Mass., terminal. While LNG is flammable, he says it is unlikely to explode. He adds that ""there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual. But until we answer the concerns, we won't be able to bring a ship in here."" 
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth-quarter projections for natural-gas prices last week. ""Prior to Sept. 11, we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back,"" said Jay Saunders, a Deutsche Banc analyst. ""But all that is out the window now."" Deutsche Banc is now estimating a 20% drop in winter demand in the industrial sector, which accounts for more than a quarter of total U.S. natural-gas consumption. The slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage, which is on pace to be full by the end of October. 
While prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers, such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural-gas demand is met. Lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms, such as EOG Resources Inc., plan to moderate production in the next two months. Gas drilling-rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1,030 at the end of August. 
Even with the increased natural-gas drilling of earlier this year, overall natural-gas supply is expected to increase just 1% this year, as the country's mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them. The tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates, increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence. 
Still, the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form. With prices high last winter, El Paso Corp. and Enron Corp., among others, said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas, which is gas compressed and frozen to minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit. ""You will see some cancellations and some delays,"" predicts Marshall Adkins, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates in Houston. 
Natural-gas prices need to average $3 per million BTUs on the East Coast and $3.50 on the West Coast to justify bringing in LNG to those areas, said Ronald Barone, an analyst with UBS Warburg. 
A spokeswoman for El Paso, Houston, says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the U.S. market. Enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the Bahamas that would pipe the gas to Florida starting in 2004.

Enron leases part of Mumbai estate to Citibank
Freny Patel MUMBAI

Copyright (c) Business Standard

After months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at Wockhardt Towers in Bandra-Kurla Complex, Enron has been able lease out 10,000 square feet of it to Citibank NA. 
Against an expected realisation from Rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors, Enron will get around Rs 1.2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to Citibank.
The deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant, Cushman & Wakefield, at a monthly rental of Rs 100 per square foot. 
With property prices in Mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the 
short run, companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets. 
Property consultants say that if Enron manages to lease out the entire four floors, it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer, as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income. 
Enron had eyed a deal of Rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around Rs 12,000 per square foot. 
This is despite the fact that real estate at Bandra Kurla currently fetches Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,000 per square feet. In June 2000, the US energy giant had shelled out Rs 125.75 crore when it acquired the four floors, plus car park space, from Wockhardt, the pharmaceutical company. 
The deal was struck at Rs 10,500 per sq ft, and included parking space for 101 cars. 
Industry sources said that Enron had spent a sum close to Rs 150 crore to acquire the property, and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired. 
In order for it to break even, it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of Rs 13,000 per square foot. 
Four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by Enron for the sale of its premises. A leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property. 
""Most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase,"" he added. 
Moreover, the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built-up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises, and Enron's proposition continues to go abegging, said the consultant.

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in ""Patient But Not Passive,"" the story that accompanies the list, ""By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion."" 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: ""We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list."" The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, ""It Took a Lady To Save Avon,"" Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, ""Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years."" Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.

Description:
	Personal Appointment

Date:		2/7/2001
Time:		12:30 PM - 1:50 PM (Central Standard Time)

Chairperson:	Outlook Migration Team

Detailed Description:"
0,"
We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

Joan,

The BOA ticket was established by John Griffith.

Two deal tickets are necessary for St. Mary's in order to segregate that 
portion of the excess volumes on which a firm delivery guarantee to the East 
Desk was made and origination was taken from that portion of the excess 
volumes which are delivered to the desk on an interruptible basis and priced 
accordingly.

George,

There should not be a deal tic for BOA [55941].  The Brazos tic #541136 has 
100% of the VPP vols, which is correct.  The other tic should not exist.  I 
am not sure if you put this in, or if John Griffith did this when the name 
change from St. Mary's to Brazos took place.  Please let me know what I need 
to do in order to get this removed/corrected. 

Also, when things slow down, we need to discuss the 2 deal tics [firm and 
spot].  Per the contract with Preston, there s/b only one tic - all the gas 
at IF TGT + 0.0025.

thanks.

We have learned the following from a talkative DTI rep:

DTI intends to  modify its existing 637 proposals.  Apparently, in light of 
customer opposition, DTI intends to withdraw its proposal to shorten the 
imbalance make-up period from 20 days to 72 hours and will instead develop a 
new rate schedule for electric generators, who it claims are the entities 
that drove DTI's need to shorten the make-up period in the first instance.

0,"FYI - I will be out of the office for the two meetings on Wednesday this 
week.  I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week.  I will be 
back in the office on Wednesday of next week. 

Todd tells me that a logo has been selected.  Can you e:mail that to me?  If 
not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next 
Wednesday.   

If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process 
and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back 
in the office next week.  My first move will be to sit down with Jeff 
Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours 
that James Scribner sent you.  When we look at numbers of confirmations and 
compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which 
activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed  
to absorb increased business more easily.  I also think that Jeff will be the 
best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to 
simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally.  All of the 
advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, 
auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm 
group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for 
implementation.  No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.

0,Thanks very much.
0,"Jay,

I wanted to send an e-mail to Imperial Sugar regarding the credit terms that 
we just talked about.  I wanted to run this e-mail by you first before I send 
it to  the customer.

Before entering into any trades, Imperial needs to post initial margin of 
$2MM with Enron.  Enron will continue to hold this cushion amount of margin 
as long as Imperial has any positions on with Enron.

Enron has the right to margin Imperial any time their MTM exposure to Enron 
exceeds $1.5MM.  We will margin in increments of $25,000.  If their exposure 
drops below $1.5MM we will return margin to them.  However, we will always 
maintain the cushion of $2MM.

Thanks,
Craig"

German ifo business sentiment fails to recover

Oct 2001				Actual	UBSW fc	Market	Previous
Headline index (1995=100)	84.7		86.0		85.0		
85.0
Balance - total			-26.2		-23.6		-18.7	
	-25.6
Balance - current conditions	-27.0		-26.4	 	na 	
	-27.7
Balance - expectations		-25.4		-20.7	 	na 	
	-23.5

n In contrast to our forecast, the ifo index of west German business 
confidence failed to recover from the shock level of September. The 
drop in the headline index of 0.3 points is not particularly worrisome. 
However, the further decline in business expectations suggests that 
production, investment and most likely employment plans have been 
slashed further at the beginning of Q4.

n Although we continue to look for a stabilisation of the ifo index 
soon , today?s data suggest that GDP will contract in the current 
quarter, consistent with our forecast. They also cast doubts over the 
expected output recovery in the early months of 2002.


The bad news in today?s ifo data is not the slight decline in the 
headline index. This alone would only have underpinned forecasts of 
industrial production and GDP decline in Q4 which is a consensus view 
anyway. The really bad news is the further fall in business 
expectations from what was considered to be an exaggeratedly weak 
post-attack shock level. It suggests that German companies are still 
far from concluding the ongoing process of adjustments in output, 
investment ad employment.

Therefore, today?s further ifo decline not only underpins forecasts of 
two consecutive GDP declines in German in Q3 and Q4, but also 
challenges the widely held expectation of a recovery in industrial 
output early next year. Chart 1 suggests that the latest ifo pattern 
has increased the risk of a double dip in German production growth. 
Despite the bad news, however, we continue to believe that the ECB will 
not cut rates further this year, but prefer to wait until early 2002 
with the next reduction in the refinance rate.

0,"Sara,  great to hear from you.  The entity requiring the brokerage account is 
Enron Energy Services, Limited, which is a UK entity.  This company is buying 
100% of the shares of a UK engineering firm (called Torpy) in order to use in 
its facilities management business here.  The purchase price for Torpy is $4 
million, $1 million of which is payable in Enron Corp. stock.  For tax 
reasons this Enron stock needs to be purchased in the market rather than 
using treasury shares.  Thanks for the tip on account signatories.  Please 
let me know what else I need to do  Thanks again.

Hello there!  Hope all is well.  Will you be at the legal conference later 
this month?

Would you please provide us with information identifying the specific entity 
requiring the brokerage account and a brief description of the transaction 
for which the account is required.  Also, for purposes of your unanimous 
consent or resolution,  you should note that either of Ted Murphy or Rick Buy 
should be one of the two signatories required for opening the account.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Sara

0,"I sent this info as discussed to Karen last week who prepared spreadsheet for Lavo.  I think the question now is how many and what will be the placement.  I also have identified several needs for Summer Interns in Fundamentals and Realtime.  Lloyd Will went through the resume book to pick summer interns for Fundamentals (provided you concur)  and the plan was to have Rika use them for analytical work during the summer backfilling them with Strong AA's from the Fall group if needed.  Juan Hernandez called me regarding adding a summer intern or two for the nightshift for confirmations etc. Just to let you know, I developed a spreadsheet with the help of Lloyd and Tom May outlining the entire Power team to track all our openings and help us orchestrate the movement of employees through power so the groups won't struggle with being short. This also will help all of our recruiters Johnny, Charles, Karen Buckley and the program folks stay focused on our needs.

2001. Once again, Enron is the title sponsor of this fabulous event. We are 
planning a media kick-off event to take place at the Holocaust Museum on 
November 20, 2000 at 10 a.m. The purpose of this event is to attract media 
attention and officially open registration for the race. If your schedule 
allows, we would like for you to speak at the kick-off again, as you did last 
year.

Mayor Brown, HISD Superintendent Rod Paige and Ed Allday, event chair for the 
Human Race, will also speak at the kick-off. The museum would like for each 
speaker to spend approximately five minutes talking about the importance of 
diversity in their respective environments. For example, the mayor will talk 
about diversity in the city of Houston, Rod Paige will speak to diversity in 
schools, Ed will talk about how the event highlights diversity, and you would 
be asked to talk about how Enron approaches diversity in the work-place.

If you are able to do this, Community Relations will draft your speaking 
points. We will call Rosie to check on your availability.

Many thanks,

Missy Stevens"

		 Subject: IMPORTANT CONFERENCE CALL ON QF/SRAC MATTERS SCHEDULED FOR 12:30 
P.M. (NOONISH) ON SUNDAY, JAN.  21

An important conference call is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, 
Today, Jan 21 to discuss the status of legislative meetings on QF/SRAC 
matters.  
 
Call-In number is            888-422-7124
Particpant Code is          111756
 
 
Status Report
After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF 
Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored ""deal"" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this 
morning.  The crux of the deal is as follows:
 
For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years [""all in"", i.e. includes 
capacity and energy]
1.0 on losses
no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity 
obligations in the past
Applies ""going forward"" (presumedly Feb. 1)
 
 
For gas-fired QFs...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;  payment will 
increase/decrease tied to gas  (this assumes an IER of 9821)
1.0 on line losses
applies ""going forward""
Caacity True-up and ""forbearance"" were not addressed.  Credit worthiness will 
be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).  
This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, 
followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.  This is 
essentially the PG&E/QF ""deal"" for the gas guys.  For the renewables, it is 
more of a fixed payment approach.
 
A ""Technical Conference"" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to 
work out some of the implementing details."

0,"On Thursday, May 17th, senior executives with Woodside Petroleum Australian 
headquarters will be in Enron's offices to discuss their company and explore 
possible opportunities with Enron.  Woodside is the largest E&P company in 
Australia.   Enron was approached a couple of weeks ago by Woodside's Houston 
representatives regarding acquisition of oil and gas assets currently managed 
by ECR.  They also requested a meeting at a senior level to discuss other 
opportunities as well since their Australian execs were visiting Houston this 
week.  The agenda below was developed with input from Woodside's Houston 
representatives.  Woodside is interested in spending $1B on domestic US 
acquisitions.  They are also a large player in the LNG and natural gas 
markets in Australia. It appears that there are several areas where Enron and 
Woodside could interact.  Enron has attempted to do some LNG business with 
Woodside recently.  They do not seem to be fully aware of Enron's domestic or 
its global presence.  A goal of this meeting is to address this 
unfamiliarity.  I have attached briefing materials on Woodside for your 
review.  Hard copies of these materials are available upon request.  Special 
thanks to David Mims for his input.  If there are any other Enron personnel 
that should meet with Woodside on Thursday, please let me know.  Also please 
circulate this email to anyone that should be advised of this meeting or 
could benefit from the materials.

                            Agenda - May 17th

Enron Global Markets has experienced tremendous growth since inception and 
this growth rate will continue to increase as new businesses and markets are 
developed.  In order to ensure EGM Operations & Accounting is positioned to 
provide the highest level of support and value to each EGM business unit, I 
am pleased to announce the following organizational changes effective 
immediately.

Physical Commodity Operations
These groups, which include Crude & Products, Coal, LNG, Freight and Weather, 
are being reorganized along functional lines to provide better focus and 
promote efficiencies across these operational activities.  Weather is being 
included in this group to maintain the consistency of current Operations 
leadership in this area.

      Business Risk Controls
Todd Hall will assume the role as Business Risk Controller on a worldwide 
basis for the physical businesses.  This group will have responsibility for 
all Risk Management activities and serve as the daily commercial interface 
for all operational issues that affect the physical businesses.

North America Operations
Michelle Bruce will assume responsibility for the following activities that 
support the physical businesses for North America:  Confirmations, 
Coordination, Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Michelle and her team will 
also play a key role in coordinating operational activities as they relate to 
potential acquisitions and new business opportunities within North America.

Europe/Asia Operations
Cindy Horn will continue in her role managing the following activities for 
the physical businesses in Europe and Asia:  Confirmations, Coordination, 
Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Cindy and her team will also have the 
critical responsibility of ensuring proper controls and processes are 
maintained for all new and existing markets throughout the region.  Tiong 
Hock Lim and his team in Singapore will report to Cindy.

Financial Commodity Operations
Sheila Glover will expand her current role and manage all business risk and 
operational activities for Financial Trading and Global Risk Management.  As 
the Global Risk Management business grows, Sheila will develop the 
operational processes and infrastructure necessary to support it.

Todd, Michelle, Cindy and Sheila will also work together as a Controller team 
to ensure processes and controls are consistent across EGM and that 
efficiencies are broadly applied.

Structuring/Transaction Analysis
Scott Earnest will assume responsibility for all commodity structuring and 
transaction analysis activities across EGM.  His duties will include pricing 
and valuation of new transactions and businesses, evaluation of existing 
transactions to identify restructuring opportunities and risk controls 
monitoring and reporting.  

Technology
Kevin Sweeney will continue in his role as Technology Controller.  Kevin and 
his team will be completing the implementation of Project Thunderball for 
Crude & Products and Coal and will also serve as the Business Leads for 
system enhancements and new technology opportunities that are identified.

Financial Operations & Accounting
Tom Myers will continue in his role of managing EGM Financial Operations & 
Accounting.  Tom and his group are responsible for EGM management reporting, 
Plan & Current Estimate preparation, the financial close process and G/L 
controls.

Please see the attached organizational chart for a more detailed look at the 
changes discussed above.

 

   Please join me in congratulating everyone on their new assignments.

		 Subject: Conectiv/Delmarva

I wanted to provide you with an update on this dispute.

As you will recall, we originally thought that we were the buyer on a Nov '00 
- March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6 and Conectiv/Delmarva was the seller.  At 
least that is what our deal ticket indicated.  Conectiv/Delmarva disagreed 
vehemently, contending that they were the buyer and we were the seller.

Last week I obtained the tapes from the broker, Natsource.  I previously 
forwarded the tapes to you.  The tapes unequivocally indicate that we were 
the seller.  In fact, the tapes reflect that we sold two Nov '00 - March '01 
basis swap @ Transco Z6 contracts at the same time -- one to 
Conectiv/Delmarva and one to Duke.  We have gone back and checked our records 
to see if we actually sold a Nov '00 - March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6 
contract to Duke at the same time we entered into a deal with 
Conectiv/Delmarva.  We did.  Notwithstanding the clear language on the tape, 
it would be hard to explain with a straight face why we would sell a swap to 
Duke and buy a swap from Conectiv/Delmarva at the same time.

After the trade, Natsource sent us a confirmation, indicating that we were 
the seller and Conectiv/Delmarva was the buyer.  Although we sent 
Conectiv/Delmarva a confirm (and they signed it) reflecting that we were the 
buyer and they were the seller, we settled the swap for the first two months 
as if we were the seller and they were the buyer.

The long and short of it is that, from a legal standpoint, there is no 
question whatsoever that the intention of the parties was that Enron would be 
the seller and Conectiv/Delmarva would be the buyer.  This is not even a 
close call.  It is my advice that we should settle the trade as if we are the 
seller and Conectiv/Delmarva is the buyer, and move on.

0,"Mike,

As a result of the recent reorganization, initially I will be responsible for 
the Weather and Insurance trading activities.  I look forward to working with 
you in these efforts.

What I really wanted to talk to you about is the JDF Walk.  Last year we 
discovered that our 2 1/2 year old son, Brandon, had diabetes.  As you 
remember, and certainly can relate to, this changed our lives forever.  In 
retrospect, I am glad that I got involved in Enron's effort even though it 
was in the last 3-4 weeks.  We have continued to stay involved with JDF by 
attending several events, by visiting the JDF office, and by JDF's proactive 
phone out-reach.  I would like to hear your take on sponsoring a team through 
Enron vs. directly through JDF.  I know that Enron matches the contributions 
if sponsored through Enron; is this possible if we were to go the other route?

Please call or email as I know we are approaching the campaign time.

Thanks,
Todd Hall

0,"Dear SVMG Member:

I need your help.

We will only limit the impact of this summer's Energy Crisis if all
Californian's make gigantic strides to reduce energy use.  With that in
mind, Governor Davis and the Legislature have passed the most aggressive
package of energy conservation incentives in the history of our Country.

Please note below a list of ways your employees - as residents - can save
money by saving energy.  I hope you will strongly consider relaying the
following e-mail message to all of your California employees.


SAVE MONEY BY SAVING POWER

As you know, California is in the midst of an Energy Crisis that is
threatening our state, the health and welfare of our citizens, and our
economy.  Fortunately, there are specific steps we can take - as businesses
and individual citizens - that can help us avoid rolling blackouts and their
devastating impacts this summer.

You may not be aware that Governor Davis and the California Legislature have
passed the most ambitious conservation incentive program in the history of
our nation.  This $1 billion package will help you - as a resident - to save
money while saving power.

Please note the information below to take advantage of these opportunities.
Along with the web site links below, please visit the Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group web site - www.svmg.org - for specific energy
conservation steps you can take at home and at work that will help save
power, save you money, and save our State's economy in the process.

Thank you for your help.

GOVERNOR'S RATE PROPOSAL:

The Governor's proposal is designed to accomplish multiple goals, including
protecting consumers from extreme market prices by securing long-term
electricity contracts and implementing a tiered rate structure to reward and
encourage conservation. Approximately 53% of California households will not
experience any rate increase. The next 23% of residential customers will
experience about a 10% average increase. Residential customers who use the
most electricity (i.e., significantly more than 130% of the ""baseline""
figure listed on each customer's bill), will experience a rate increase of
24% on average.

Hi Sara--

There are open issues regarding the L/C faciltity, so Carol and I decided not 
to comment on specific clauses until those issues were resolved.  I believe 
Carol was ok with Section 18, but it was added shortly before she left for 
maternity leave.  Because we are still trading with you under the existing BT 
ISDA, the clause is simply meant to sweep-in any exisiting BT-Enron trades 
under the new DB-Enron facility.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.  My understanding is 
that we are now scheduled to talk on Wed. at 11am NY time. I look forward to 
talking with you then.

Regards,

Steve

Steven:

I am trying to finalize this master during Carol St. Clair's absence.  I have 
a
few questions prior to our comments.  They are:

(1)  Have you already commented on the new form of Letter of Credit Provisions
which Carol sent to you?  This is referred to as Exhibit A to Paragraph 13 of
Annex A.  I did not see your response.

(2)  Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?  I did not see your
response.

(3)  What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.  I know that 
DB
acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?  Have both
parties agreed as to existing transactions?

Please let me hear from you.  Thanks.  Sara





"
0,"Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would ""file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA"" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  

Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

out Saturday.

I talked to the hotel and they have rooms and a scuba instructor available
to dive with us.  Let me know your flights so that I can arrange the
air transfers between Belize City and Placencia and dive lessons through
the hotel.  I haven't booked it yet since they require a non-refundable

0,"Joe, 

Thanks for the email.    I am looking forward to the trip and learning more 
about what you are doing thus how we can help.  If we would have had any idea 
that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some 
things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.  Thursday sounds 
great and just let me know about Friday.  Is Anthony in japan during the 
trip?  Remember,  I am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss 
technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential 
ideas and opportunities.

A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any 
presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  Also, what is 
the appropriate dress code.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make 
any assumptions about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you 
can fax me about the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  Do I have clear 
instruction how to take the train from the airport.  I normally get a driver, 
I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak any of the language.  
If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.

One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me 
at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it 
really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel 
after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the 
Japanese culture.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

We are looking to accomplish a number of things while you are here over 
Thursday and Friday.  Thursday's schedule is fairly set, and we are working 
on Friday.  Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you 
the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for 
enron.co.jp.  This would take us through mid afternoon.  We would then go 
over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology 
at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.  We would bring EJ over to 
EPower for your talk.  Afterwards we would have drinks with the main 
commercial team at EPower and EJ.  Dinner to be arranged for a smaller 
group.  On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with 
key IT/tech companies here in Japan.  To date, we have not yet met any of 
these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity 
in the country.  We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking 
relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of 
Softbank.  We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.  We are 
also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on 
Enron and Enron Technology.  The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest 
chambers in the world and bring in some quite interesting speakers.  We will 
have more on this.

For the weekend we have recd some suggestions from the Hotel and will pass 
these along to you shortly.

I will be travelling with you on Sunday on the trip to Seoul.

Joe, 

I am looking forward to the upcoming trip.  

Everything is all set for Korea but what do you suggest as an agenda for my 
two days in Tokyo?  Also are there some presentations or items that i could 
review before I arrive that you believe might be helpful?  I will also be 
there over a weekend, I would like to do some site seeing on Sat and Sunday 
(my flight to Korea leaves on Sunday late afternoon).  I would appreciate 
some suggestions and I will need a guide, could you have someone arrange it 
for me?

Thanks, and Cathy will co-ordinate everything.

0,"Brent, Andrea and I had a ""status"" conversation this afternoon.  Brent will 
go to Sao Paulo on July 20 to meet with Andrea, Randy and commercial people.  
Andrea has requested that you and I go to Brazil after July 28 when the 
outside lawyer is back from vacation.  In general, the three of us are 
conforming and updating physical resolutions (final and proposed) and 
identifying additional research necessary to address the financial trading 
issues.  These are related to specific deals originating in Brazil (which are 
truly settled financially, e.g., a purported prepay where no physical 
commodity was to be delivered) and issues arising here in Houston (e.g., the 
Hickerson request for fixed income, FX and equity trading).  Brent will be 
discussing pending transaction structures while in Sao Paulo. 

It appears  that Brent is the ""point person"" for dealing directly with the 
Sao Paulo office and he will bring me in as necessary (although I will be 
dealing frequently with Andrea).

0,"News : FERC Approves Independence, SupplyLink Projects 
2:00 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000
 
After submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent 
agreements 
for firm transportation capacity, the highly contested Independence Pipeline 
and related 
SupplyLink pipeline projects were approved by FERC this morning. The two 
projects 
have been pending at FERC for more than three years.

The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas 
transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in 
Pennsylvania. 
The ""tentative"" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their 
downstream 
partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be 
operating 
a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and 
National 
Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an 
investment 
of about $1.5 billion.

The Commission approved the ""greenfield"" Independence project over 
significant 
opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they 
were not 
convinced the new precedent agreements provided ""sufficient evidence"" of 
market 
support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at 
least 35% 
of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26.

Subject: OCS Final Rule, Order 639


Regulations Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Governing the 
Movement of Natural Gas on Facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf, RM99-5 

The final rule is attached - 84 pages      



Executive Summary
The Final Rule was issued April 10, 2000 and becomes effective 30 days after 
publication in the Federal Register.

The purpose of the final rule is to establish a data base as a foundation for 
identifying discrimination with OCS gas service providers.  The reporting 
will include affiliations and conditions of service.  This is a procedural 
rule - reporting only.  The rule only applies to gas pipelines - FERC found 
transportation for oil pipelines to be just and reasonable.  The Commission 
is acting in part as a response to the ruling in Sea Robin in which the court 
directed FERC to reconsider the manner in which it applied its primary 
function test to Sea Robin's predominantly offshore system.  

NOPR was issued on June 30, 1999.  The Commission believes that the new OCSLA 
reporting requirements mirror certain existing NGA reporting requirements.  
Salient points of the final rule are:

Exemptions
Service providers that confine their operations to moving their own gas or 
that of a single shipper are exempt from reporting; add new section 
330.0(a)(1) and (2)   Note:  reporting exemption turns on identity of service 
provider and its shippers - not type of service provided.
Gas service providers that are regulated by FERC under NGA are exempt from 
OCSLA reporting; add new section (330.3(a)(4)
Exempts lines that feed into a facility where gas is first collected, 
separated, dehydrated or processed from OCSLA reporting requirements; add new 
section 330.3(a)(3).

Reporting Requirements
If an NGA-regulated company's system includes OCS facilities that are not 
subject to NGA (gathering/production lines), the company must submit an OCSLA 
report covering its non-NGA facilities
Reclassified facilities will no longer be subject to NGA reporting 
requirements but will be subject to OCSLA requirements. (Shippers  no longer 
have protection against the exercise of market power afforded by the NGA). 
Service provider must list all of its affiliates defined as engaged in the 
exploration, development, production, processing, transportation, marketing, 
consumption or sale of gas need be identified in the report; new section 
330.2(a)(6)
Reporting Updates restricted to four times per year.  
Reports will be based on conditions on the first day of the first full 
calendar quarter that begins after the effective date of this rule; reports 
due on the first business day after the close of the quarter.  Providers will 
have more than one full quarter in which to prepare their initial OSCLA report
Providers will be required to submit a description of their operations as 
they stand on the first day of each calendar quarter, e.g. describing the 
provider's status on one particular day; report due on first business day of 
the subsequent quarter (e.g. filing due April 1 will describe operations as 
they stood on January 1).  If the operations are identical on the first and 
last days of any given quarter, provider need not submit an update the 
following quarter
Not necessary to file contracts but must provide table of shippers and 
services; new section 330.2(b)
Retaining requirement for alternative reporting for OCS companies who do not 
provide service under formal contracts, must provide information sufficient 
to derive rates charged and conditions applicable for service between two 
points; new section 330.2(b)(9)
OCSLA Reporting Form available via Internet  http://www.ferc.fed.us or the 
public reference room
Providers new to provisions have 90 days to prepare and submit OCSLA report 
(NOPR had stipulated 60 days).

0,"El Paso Line #1103

?	The El Paso restart approval has switched from the OPS to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  The NTSB is currently investigating the explosion to determine a cause to the blast.

?	Once cause is established, the project will then shift back to the OPS, when they will begin to analyze the data from tests that El Paso is currently running.  At this point, OPS may request El Paso to either rerun certain tests or perform further repairs.

?	The individual at OPS (in charge of El Paso's South Mainline) indicated that all 3 lines were being investigated and tested.  OPS will begin to analyze the test data one line at a time (ex.  line 1103 will be completely tested, analyzed, and cleared for use before following the same steps for lines 1100 and 1110).  The source indicated that as these lines are being tested/repaired the current pressure on the system will not increase but instead be maintained.

?	We are currently developing sources at the NTSB for the following information:

heard in the Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday next week.  He said the
committee at this time is fairly neutral on the bill since he doesn't see
that it does anything.  He understands our problems with the bill, but
suggested we may want to recommend a solution.  IEP will be meeting with him
this afternoon to give him the problem at the 50,000 foot level.  Individual
companies may want to give him the specifics.

Where are we with our meetings with members of the committee?

IEP met with Kip in Sher's office who was noncommittal, but agreed with our
arguments against the bill. IEP's meeting with Alarcon was cancelled.  We
are trying to reschedule.  Since this is a special session bill, Dunn and
Poochigian will be voting on the bill.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165."

A TRUE FRIEND

When you are sad ...
I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.

When you are blue ...
I'll try to dislodge what ever's choking you.

When you smile ...
I'll know you finally got laid.

When you are scared ...
I will rag you about it every chance I get.

When you are worried ...
I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and tell
you to quit whining.

When you are confused ...
I will use little words to explain it to your dumb ass.

When you are sick ...
Stay the hell away from me until you're well again, I don't want whatever
you have.

When you fall ...
I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

This is my oath ...
I pledge till the end. Why you may ask? ...
Because you're my friend.

Deal QD 8473 is not a Reliant deal, nor is it an EOL Gas Daily swap.  Deal QE

Subject: Gas Daily deals in dispute

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

0,"NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.

Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and

Scott Sitter (Crestone) and I have been working on this.  Scott has been trying to reconcile with FUGG on the 12/99 - 10/00 imbalances, then we can take it from there.  

I forwarded this e-mail to Scott to see when we can get together to finalize this.  I will get you a complete summary with all the backup as soon as I can.  (My guess is the last week of November - 1st week of December.  Scott is out most of this week on vacation and I'm out next week.)

I'll talk to you soon.

relationship with the risk policy
Economic vs earnings risk - what should be captured

In all cases, if Fred's group is able to make a case that the CFO truly is the financial contact, then we are prepared to leave as is.... otherwise as per Mark's note, I would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all Rockies and San Juan producers ( both physical and paper ) and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the Denver office as we had always planned.

As of this morning, Jeremy has noticed that the daily change and Vega is kind 
of a bit too much with the vol skew
and identified that there was an error in my code for passing the prior day 
MidPr, which caused errors in
the Prior day value and daily change numbers. Now the code is fixed.
I run a few new post_id, and the changes look much smooth.

SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY 
REGULATION 





Senators Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and Jean Carnahan, D-Mo., have asked the 
General Accounting Office (GAO) to inquire into whether the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC) is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure 
that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and 
that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to 
customers. ""Under federal law, FERC has the responsibility to ensure just
and 
reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission,"" the Senators said 
in a letter to GAO, ""but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have 
fulfilled this role in the California situation."" Following is text of the 
letter: 

April 12, 2001 

Mr. David M. Walker 
Comptroller General of the United States 
U.S. General Accounting Office 
441 G Street, N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20548 

Dear Mr. Walker: 

We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers
sporadic 
rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout

the western United States, a situation that may get worse this summer when 
the demand for electricity increases. We understand that there are many 
factors that have contributed to the current situation, and few short term 
options to create more electricity for this market. At the same time we are 
extremely troubled that California's Independent System Operator (ISO) 
recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly

been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the 
electricity, an overcharge amounting to $6.8 billion according to the 
operator. Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a 
non-functioning market that has, in turn, exacerbated the state's
electricity 
shortage.With the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in 
additional states such as Missouri, we are concerned whether there is 
adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power 
by suppliers. Without such oversight, the nation may not progress towards 
achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation: lower consumer 
prices, greater reliability, increased choice, and more efficient
generation. 
Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the 
oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission (PSC), which

works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity 
or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates, to the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under federal law, FERC has the 
responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale

transmission, but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have
fulfilled 
this role in the California situation. FERC Commissioner William Massey 
recently said: ""Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets 
requires that we clearly define market power, and aggressively intervene
when 
the markets are not producing reasonable prices. The commission's actions to

date have been insufficient."" (March 20, 2001 testimony to the House Energy 
Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Air quality).We are requesting that 
the General Accounting Office (GAO) assess whether FERC is properly 
exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates. Specifically,
we 
ask GAO to answer the following questions: 

1) Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates? Is 
FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its
statutes 
power supply, demand, and pricing in California? In other Western states? In

the Central Midwest and in the Northeast? 

2) Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight 
obligations in a timely and effective manner? And does FERC have the 
necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role? 

3) Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring 
just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now

occurring in so many states? 

4) As we understand the situation from some experts, the number of 
transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market 
place is voluminous. This situation may increase the difficulties of
guarding 
against market abuse. Is there a role for another agency or independent 
organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these 
transactions? If so, what would be an appropriate oversight role? 

5) We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices 
relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market 
would help guard against market abuses. We understand the need to keep
prices 
confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion. After this 
appropriate period of time has passed, would greater transparency be 
beneficial? 

We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public 
Utility Commission (CPUC) that market power has been abused in the 
transmission of natural gas, which has in turn contributed to the spiraling 
cost of electricity generation in the state. The CPUC maintains that the 
price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been
manipulated 
so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times 
the national average. Because an increasing number of states, including 
California, rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants, any manipulation

of that commodity can have severe consequences. Additionally, because such a

large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural 
gas, we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have 
even more profound effects. Therefore, we ask GAO to answer the following 
questions: 

1) Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate

pipelines? If not, what areas require improvement? 

2) Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to 
the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines? Should
this 
role be enhanced or clarified, and if so, how? 

3) Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other
parts 
of the country, aside from California, where the natural gas pipeline 
capacity is similarly limited? Please provide any details.We appreciate all 
the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Sincerely,J 

oseph I. Lieberman 
Jean Carnahan

0,"FYI, I've faxed PG&E's filing to Rick Shapiro.  If others don't have it and 
want it, let me know and I'll fax it.  The filing's brief--about 10 
pages--with more detail apparently to be filed.  It lists the top 20 
creditors.  The only ENE listing in the filing is ENE Canada at $28M.  

The other thing that Governor and his PUC could have done many months ago was 
realign rates to more accurately reflect the real cost of power.  That 
arguably was a key determinant driving PG&E to Bankruptcy.

Subject: Response Statement to PG&E's Ch. 11 Filing

It's unfortunate that the state's largest utility was forced to turn to the 
courts for a resolution.  Solutions to the state's energy crisis have been 
available for months that would have avoided this scenario, but Gov. Davis 
and the Legislature lacked the bold leadership to take swift, decisive 
action. 

Enron's exposure to PG&E will not have any material effect on earnings or on 
our financial condition.

If pressed:  Any further comment would be speculative, as we have not yet 
seen the filing.

Stronger Defense, Improved Punting, Explosive Offense Give Horns Chance to
Stay in Top 10

With two-a-day workouts almost over and the opening game just around the
corner, there is some great news for Longhorn football fans.
That 17-year absence from the final top 10 could be over for three big
reasons:
1.The defense looks even stronger than last year's unit, which ranked No. 6
nationally.
2. Kris Stockton is punting so strongly that coach Mack Brown says the pros
are interested.
3. The offense, which couldn't score in the final ten quarters of last
season, is so explosive that it should be able to score on anybody.
But let's temper that great news with a word or two of caution about the
offense. While it is capable of breaking a long touchdown play against anyo=
ne
on the schedule, it still doesn't look like an offense that can make long,
time-consuming drives against a quality opponent.
It won't be as quick to punt or score as the offenses at the really
pass-happy schools on the schedule this year, but there might be a scary
number of three-and-outs against good defenses.
That won't necessarily be fatal to the Longhorns' high hopes, if the offens=
e
and special teams can avoid costly mistakes that leave the defense a short
field to defend.
The Longhorn defensive unit is so strong that it will force most teams to
punt quickly, too.
Another great asset this season will be defensive depth. When the Longhorn
offense sputtered down the stretch last year, the defenders sometimes simpl=
y
wore down through repeated exposure.
But the second defensive unit has been formidable in practice. It allowed t=
he
No. 1 offense one touchdown in seven possessions in Saturday's scrimmage.
Brown said the only big difference in the first and second units is at
defensive tackle, where the first team has All-American Casey Hampton and a
guy the pros like even better, Shaun Rogers.
But Rogers says the dropoff at tackle isn't that great when the second unit
comes in. ""When Casey and I come out, Stevie (Lee) and Marcus (Tubbs) are
really good young players who are just going to keep on getting better and
better.""
While Hampton and Rogers are seniors, Lee is a true freshman, who enrolled =
in
January so he could go through spring practice, and Tubbs is a redshirt
freshman who came to Texas as a tight end before growing into a formidable
defensive tackle.
The Longhorns are still a very young team, with  Hampton, Rogers and free
safety Greg Brown the only senior starters on defense, and tackles Leonard
Davis and Cory Quye the only likely senior starters on defense. Stockton, w=
ho
will handle the punting and place kicking, also is a senior.
Brandon Healy is starting at wide receiver now, but the fifth-year senior i=
s
being pushed by the heralded freshmen, who are developing rapidly.
Let's take a look at what the Longhorn offense did last year and what it
meant to the team. The figures below show game-by-game rushing, passing and
total offense yardage, plus the number of sacks the opponents garnered.
* * * *
Rush     Pass   Total   Sacks
NC State (L, 23-20)   56    316 372 4-34
Stanford (W, 69-17) 178 380 558 1-6
Rutgers  (W, 38-21) 141 244 385 2-14
Rice (W, 18-13)     209 246 455 1-15
Baylor (W, 62-0)    233 353 586 0-0
K-State (L, 35-17)    34    271 305 4-40
Oklahoma (W, 38-28) 225 328 553 0-0
Nebraska (W, 24-20)   62    213 275 1-8
Iowa State (W, 44-41)   129 345 474 3-31
O-State  (W, 34-21) 177 242 419 2-11
Texas Tech (W, 58-7)    217 287 504 4-28
Texas A&M (L, 20-16)      89    183 272 2-20
Nebraska (L, 22-6)      6   172 178 7-44
Arkansas (L, 27-6)          -27 212 185 8-64
* * * *
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that the Longhorns were 7-0 when
they had more than 400 yards offensively and an even more impressive 8-0 wh=
en
they had 100 yards net rushing.
The flip side of that coin is that they were 2-5 when they had less than 40=
0
yards offensively and an ever worse 1-5 when they had less than 100 yards n=
et
rushing.
They also had five games in which they gave up more than four sacks and the
only one of those they won was against Texas Tech.
To keep history from repeating itself, the Horns need to start percolating =
on
offense.
Now, let's look at the upcoming season. Coach Brown doesn't mind the
pollsters picking UT No. 7 in the country, and he also is glad they think t=
he
Longhorns can contend for the national championship.
""We've sold 50,000 season tickets because of the fans' enthusiasm and
support,"" he said Sunday. ""The fans are talking about winning a national
championship, too, and we haven't finished in the top 10 in 17 years, but
that's a good thing, too. We have high expectations and we want the fans to
have high expectations for us.""
Brown said the team has a chance to be good if it can eliminate some of the
mental mistakes that  cropped up last year and continue to improve.
Texas ranked near the bottom nationally last season in net punting, averagi=
ng
slightly under 30 net yards per kick.
He said the goal this year is to average 38 yards net punting, and he said
Stockton is punting so well in practice that ""the pro scouts are showing so=
me
interest.""
""Overall, our punting is so much better than it was last year,"" he said.
Brown also said he thinks starting tailback Hodges Mitchell is even quicker
than he was last year and will be able to get the Horns some yardage as the
primary punt returner, and he said backup tailbacks Ivan Williams and Victo=
r
Ike will be the primary kickoff returners.
""We think we will be better in all those areas,"" he said.
True freshman CB Nathan Vasher ran a punt back 79 yards for a touchdown in
Saturday's scrimmage, and Brown said he probably will use him as a punt
returner at some point in the season.
Here's a look at how the team is developing, on a position-by-position basi=
s:
OFFENSE
Quarterback
Major Applewhite, the Big 12 Co-Offensive Player of the Year last season
after throwing for a school record 3,357 yards and another school record 21
touchdowns, seems to be fully recovered from off-season knee surgery, but h=
e
is locked in a battle with super talented sophomore Chris Simms for the
starting job.
Brown says he thinks both will play in the NFL and he says it's a great
problem to have. ""I've had teams with no quarterbacks,"" he said. ""I like th=
is
a lot better.""
Brown also says everyone has an opinion about who will start, ""but I'm the
one who will make the decision because I'm the one who will get fired if it
doesn't work out.""
He also said both will play a lot this season.
Beau Trahan, a high school quarterback who switched to safety at UT, has be=
en
moved back to quarterback, and he threw a touchdown pass in Saturday's
scrimmage. He is very mobile and has a good arm.
Chance Mock, the heralded recruit from The Woodlands, is a great prospect.
He's built like a linebacker at 6-2, 215, but he runs like a wide receiver
and has a powerful, accurate arm. Brown  wants to redshirt him, and he want=
s
to redshirt.
Running Back
All Big 12 tailback Hodges Mitchell is back after rushing for 1,343 yards a=
nd
catching 32 passes for 343 more yards.
Converted linebacker Matt Trissel is the fullback, and he is a good one. He=
's
an outstanding blocker, good receiver and tough power runner.
Sophomore Victor Ike, the fastest of the tailbacks, has been looking good i=
n
practice, and currently is running ahead of Kenny Hayter and Ivan Williams
for the backup tailback job.
Converted tight end Chad Stevens and Brett Robin are the backup fullbacks.
Freshmen TB Sneezy Beltran and freshman FB Will Matthews are looking good i=
n
practice, but could be redshirted because of the depth at their positions.
Tight End
The coaches spent much of the spring building a passing attack around
multi-talented sophomore Bo Scaife, a 235-pounder with great speed. He was
slowed last season after undergoing knee surgery following his senior seaso=
n
in high school, but was sensational during spring drills.
On the very first day of fall practice, he hurt the other knee in a
non-contact drill and has already undergone surgery to fix it.
He is out for the season, but Brown said the injury was not as severe as th=
e
one to the other knee and said he should be ready to go by spring practice.
Since he played as a true freshman, this will be his redshirt year.
Junior Mike Jones is an outstanding blocker and good receiver, and he came
back 15 pounds lighter and a little quicker. He will do a fine job, but he
won't scare people with his speed.
Freshman Brock Edwards is a big, fast prospect and the coaches are working
hard to get him ready to play. He isn't as fast as Scaife, but he is very
fast for a 6-5, 260-pounder.
Wide Receiver
Redshirt freshman Artie Ellis and fifth-year senior Brandon Healy are the
starters, but true freshmen Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson have been
outstanding in practice and will play a lot, even if they don't start.
Williams, 6-3, 205, and probably the fastest player on the team, has been
making sensational catches almost every day in practice, and Johnson, 6-1,
185, and super fast, too, caught a 75-yard scoring pass from Applewhite
against the first-team defense in Saturday's scrimmage.
Two other true freshmen, Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery, are 6-2 speedsters
who also are pushing for playing time.
There is little experience, but a lot of young talent at wide receiver. The
youngsters may struggle in the early games, but some of them will help a lo=
t
this season and all of them are fast enough to scare defenses.
Line
Four starters return, and super sophomore Derrick Dockery, the lone new
starter, might be the best of the bunch. The line did a good job early last
season, but caught much of the blame for the late-season collapse.
Center Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from sophomore Beau Bake=
r
at center, and Cory Quye is holding off Mike Williams at right tackle for
now. Dockery is a fixture at left guard, Leonard Davis is getting some
All-America mention at left tackle and Antwan Kirk-Hughes is in control at
right guard.
Brown has called Dockery ""the best true freshman lineman I have ever coache=
d.""
Sophomore Robbie Doane is a strong backup at tackle, and redshirt freshman
Tillman Holloway is a talented newcomer at guard.
The line will be better because of the extra year's experience. The key
question is the degree of improvement.
DEFENSE
End
Nine starters return from a fine defense, but both seniors in 1999 were the
two defensive ends.
Sophomore Cory Redding, the Big 12 Defensive Newcomer of the Year last year=
,
looks like a future All-American at right end. He is a great pass rusher an=
d
an improving run stopper.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese plans to try to fill the left end spot by
using three or four players. Jermain Anderson, quick but undersized at 232
pounds, is the starter. He is a fine pass rusher, but is too small to play
full time. Sophomore Cole Pittman has moved over from tackle because of his
run-stopping ability. Maurice Gordon and Adam McConathy also will play. The=
y,
like Anderson, excel at rushing the passer.
Reese likes the size and quickness of true freshman Kalen Thornton, who is
about 6-3 and 265. He says he will try to work him in  early this season to
see what he can do.
Tackle
Seniors Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers are a formidable duo and probably ar=
e
the best pair of tackles in college football. Hampton was a first-team AP
All-American last year, and Rogers is bigger, quicker and at times even mor=
e
dominating.
True freshman Stevie Lee, who graduated from high school early so he could =
go
through spring practice at UT, and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs are
outstanding backups. Another redshirt freshman, Ryan Haywood, has a lot of
potential.
Linebacker
Reese has four outstanding linebackers who are concentrated at two position=
s,
which is why he plans to play nickel (five defensive backs, only two
linebackers) defenses at least half the time
Juniors De'Andre Lewis in the middle and Everick Rawls on the weak side
(opposite the tight end) are returning starters who just keep getting bette=
r.
Sophomore O. J. McClintock also has been looking great on the weak side, an=
d
redshirt freshman Reed Boyd is pushing Lewis in the middle.
So, there is great quality and depth at two of the three spots.
On the strong side, however, juniors Tyrone Jones and Marcus Wilkins have n=
ot
drawn a lot of praise from Reese.
He just says the Longhorns play five or six teams who pass most of the time
and he will pull his strong side backer and play an extra defensive back.
He likes to have his quickest players in the game and all of his cornerback=
s
are good tacklers
Look for five or six defensive backs to letter before either strongside
backer letters.
Secondary
All four starters return, but junior Quentin Jammer and sophomore Roderick
Babers appear to be beating out returning cornerback regulars Ahmad Brooks
and Ervis Hill.
Jammer, living up to his name, is great when it comes to jamming receivers
and keeping them from getting off the line. He is big and physical.
Babers is a speedster who played a lot as the nickel back last year. He has
great man-for-man coverage skills and always looks for the pick.
Regardless of who wins the starting jobs, all of the cornerbacks will play =
in
Reese's nickel and dime packages. He also plans to substitute them a lot
because they do so much running.
True freshman Nathan Vasher also is pushing for playing time.
At safety, senior Greg Brown and junior Lee Jackson are returning starters.
Backing them up are redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson, who is looking very
good this fall, and true freshman Phillip Geiggar, who graduated early so h=
e
could go through spring practice at Texas. Geiggar also looks like a future
star.
Reese usually plays extra cornerbacks in his nickel and dime lineups, but h=
e
has been working Pearson as a nickel back in some situations.
Football Notes . .
Two freshmen =01) running back Tyrone Richardson and linebacker Aurmon Satc=
hell
=01) have left the team at least temporarily to resolve some academic probl=
ems.
Richardson won't be back until January at the earliest. Satchell said he
hopes to get his problems resolved by the NCAA Clearinghouse in time to
rejoin the team this week.

Texas Gets Top RB Cedric Benson as Lucky 13th Recruit

Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, of Midland Lee, the all-time Class 5A champ =
in
yardage gained and touchdowns scored, is a future Longhorn.
Thirteen is supposed to be an unlucky number, but not in this case because
Benson is the Longhorns' 13th early commitment, and he is a rare jewel.
He ran for an incredible 3,526 yards and scored an equally incredible 51
touchdowns last season to lead Lee to a 15-0 State Championship season.
Benson scored 44 TDs rushing and caught 14 passes for 360 yards and the oth=
er
seven scores.
He ran roughshod over a very good Aldine Eisenhower team in the state final=
s,
rushing for 192 yards and four touchdowns and bolting 78 yards with a scree=
n
pass for another TD in a 42-21 victory.
That was just another typical day for Benson, who had 238 yards and five TD=
s
in the state finals as a sophomore en route to a 2,000-yard season and 37
touchdowns.
Why did he pick the Longhorns over all the other top schools who offered
scholarships?
""I've always liked the University of Texas,"" he said. ""I like the way they
use their running backs and have a balanced offense. The UT offense is a lo=
t
like the one we run here at Lee.""
Benson said he was pulling for Ricky Williams to win the Heisman Trophy in
1998, and said Texas has been his top choice since he started drawing
recruiting attention.
Asked how many scholarship offers he has received, Benson said he quit
counting after 20. He also said the only other team he seriously considered
was Miami, ""but I like Texas better and it's a lot closer to home.""
Legendary high school coach Gordon Wood, who won multiple state titles at
Stamford and Brownwood before retiring several years ago,  says Benson ""is
the best running back I ever saw in high school.""
Wood's teams had some great backs and they played against some other great
backs, so he has seen more than his share of the great ones.
Benson is a back who sets up blockers extremely well and seems to sense whe=
re
a hole will be before it opens. He is an instinctive runner who is shifty a=
nd
hard to bring down.
He is on all the national top 100 lists as are fellow Texas pledges Jonatha=
n
Scott of Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, both
offensive linemen.
OL Alfio Randall of Blinn JC, another Texas commitment, was a national top
100 prospect two years ago at Houston Yates.
Randall  had hoped  to enroll at Texas in January, but he needs 24 more hou=
rs
at Blinn, so he will have to remain at the junior college through the sprin=
g
semester to graduate. That will delay his enrollment at Texas until next fa=
ll.
Here's a list of the Horns' early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter, is a national top 100 player.
He is super quick for his size and has the long arms college coaches want f=
or
the key left tackle spot.
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village,  is another national top 100
player. He plays tight end at Jersey Village and is the top blocker for sup=
er
junior RB Selvin Young, who ran for 2,204 yards last year as a sophomore.
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC, was a national top 100 player two
years ago. He is super strong and extremely quick.
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park, broke the Aggies' hearts by changi=
ng
his early commitment to Texas. He is an offensive lineman with a defensive
linemen's aggressive temperament.
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls, is another highly recruited star
who has quick feet and great lateral movement
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, another of the state's top eight offensive
linemen. He is a physically dominating blocker with good footwork and  a
strong upper body.
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview, has a very quick start and, like
Garcia, is aggressive with his blocks.
Running Back (1)
Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee, the state's top running back an=
d
another national top 100 player.
Linebacker (1)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison, was the middle backer the
Longhorns targeted early. He is very physical and tough, and he has great
quickness.
Defensive Back (4)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.42, San Antonio Holmes, one of the state's top
two cornerbacks. He is the kind of tall, fast (10.5 100 meter time) corner
who loves man-for-man coverage and is very good at it.
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship, a great option QB who wi=
ll
play safety at Texas. He was the Class 4A Offensive Player of the Year last
season while leading Stephenville to the Class 4A state title. He moved to
the suburbs of Lubbock because his father, Art, left his job as head coach =
at
Stephenville to become an assistant at Texas Tech.
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity, a fine athlete who will play
QB this season. He is a real head hunter
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands, a two-way star at WR and CB.
So far, only seven member of  Dave Campbell's Texas Football magazine's
24-man Super Team have committed to colleges, and the Longhorns have six of
them.
Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the state'=
s
top football magazine and he is joined on the Super Team by Briles, Griffin=
,
Scott, Young and Robinson.
The other Super Team  player who has committed is Madisonville running back
David Underwood, who says he will sign with Michigan.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns' search for a quarterback recruit has been
narrowed down to the best one in Texas and the best one in Louisiana. Matt
Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch is the top Texas QB recruit and Bret Rawls =
of
Shreveport Evangel is the top one in Louisiana. Rawls backed up superstar
Brock Berlin last year, but has soared to the top of the recruiting charts
after attending several major college summer camps. . . Eric Hall, the
outstanding defensive end prospect from Clarksville, Tenn., still plans to
take his official visit the Sept. 9 weekend. . . With 13 recruits already
committed and no defensive lineman among them, that is where at least five =
or
six of the remaining scholarships will be awarded. DT Tommie Harris of
Killeen Ellison is the key one because he is the top-rated DT in the nation
and because he is the only great one in the high school ranks in Texas this
year. Paul Broussard is a great one at Blinn JC, and he is very interested =
in
Texas, but he has a lot of work to do in the classroom. The Longhorns are
recruiting some big DEs who good grow into tackles, like Kaelen Jakes, 6-5,
260, 4.8, of Valencia, Cal. He lived in Plano during junior high.


Last Open Scrimmage Wednesday

The Longhorns will end two-a-days Monday and Tuesday with 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
practices at Whitaker Field, then have their last open scrimmage Wednesday =
at
6 p.m. at Royal Memorial Stadium.
Coach Mack Brown said he plans to give the team Friday, Satuday and Sunday
off, then begin game week preparations next Monday."

Jordan,
 
I think this looks good.  There is one other area that you may want to include:  Develop relationships with governmental agencies that enforce discrimination/affirmative action laws, regulations, and Executive Orders.  
 
I have been taking the lead on this, with support from Steve Kean and Cindy, but we are just starting the effort this month.  Steve and I will meet with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs this week, and I am hoping to meet with the head of the OFCCP (and, perhaps folks with EEOC in Washington) later in the month.  I believe that cordial, cooperative relationships with these agencies can be invaluable in our diversity efforts.
 
If you choose to include this activity, it probably would belong in the Communication or Resources sections (it could be included in the section on creation of external relationships).
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Michelle

Attached is the revised summary of the recommendations coming out of the Diversity Subcommittee.  If there are additional comments, please feel free to pass them on.

Is is also my understanding that Jeff is working with Andrea and Michelle regarding the ""metrics'' accumulated with respect to diversity performance with a focus on verification, context, and presentation so as to supplement our recommendations.  In that regard (and after discussing with Kirk), we should begin organizing a formal presentation for the OTC of these materials.  One approach may be as follows:

(1) Convert the Recommendations and Metrics into approximately 5 slides: (a) Slide 1-Overview; (b) Slide 2-What type of data was used as support and why; (c) Slide 3-  Presentation of the metrics and what we believe that data is indicating; (d) Review of Recommendations/Action Items and the supporting Business Case; and (e) Next Steps.

(2) Identify and present key metrics; identify backup slides with data points. 

I am hopeful that we can finalize these items in the next week so we can review with Cindy in early October and be prepared to meet with the OTC sometime in October.

Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.  Thank you for your time. 

Jordan

0,"Great!  We've got a meeting set for 9 am on Wed on the regulatory structure 
of the pipeline.  Also, I talked to Kevin and Tim separately today on the 
market research issue.  I think Tim could probably identify the specific 
electric rate PNM charges DOE at Sandia and DOD at Kirtland as well as the 
general tariff rate for large industrial service.  If we are lucky, there 
might be some info in PNM's last rate case on the discounted electric rates 
it gives specific large industrials (if any).  Obviously, any info on gas or 
elec. loads and rates would be useful.  Kevin, I told Tim you'd give him a 
call to convey further thoughts, but this is probably enough to get Tim 
started.

I got a call this afternoon from Tino.  He asked our help on right of way 
issues with BNSF.  Could Steve, Kevin or Lorraine take point on trying to 
find out if we or anyone within Enron has a good contact at BNSF that we 
could use?  Lets keep all such external contacts very discreet to avoid 
tipping PNM that Enron is involved.  Just in general on the confidentiality 
issue, Tim reminded me of an important date we all need to keep in mind--the 
current leglislative session in Santa Fe ends Feb. 17.  We need to be 
absolutely sure that we don't tip PNM off that we are talking to Langley 
before then so we don't get them interested in the leglislative fix we are 
supporting on the Plains-Tri State merger.  Tim believes PNM could spike that 
leglislative fix in a heartbeat if they wanted to.  That issue is real 
immediate dollars, so lets not let a future deal screw up a present deal 
(even a lawyer like me can figure out the cost benefit on that situation).

Tino had a new fact to work into the economics:  DOE has 6000MMBtu/d of pure 
gas load at Sandia in addition to elec. load.  No number yet on Kirtland gas 
load.  Also, Tino has heard that a guy named Jeff Sturba will likely replace 
Montoya at PNM before the end of the year.  Has anyone else heard that?  Do  
we know him?     

I told Tino that one of us would give him a call back by the end of the week 
just to report in on our analysis.  At minimum, we can probably pass on the 
name of a contact at Enron Wind for Tino to bother on the windmill thing.  
Turned out that the wind pilot project is on the Rosebud reservation in S.D. 
and has nothing to do with the Albuquerque project anyway.  Sorry about the 
random message but thats how my brain is working today.  DF

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes closed slightly lower on Friday due to light profit
taking ahead of the weekend. Nevertheless, this week's rally to new
highs for October keeps the fall rally intact and sets the stage for
a possible test of fib resistance crossing at 1857.56 later this
fall. The December S&P 500 index also closed slightly lower in quiet
trading on Friday leaving Thursday's key reversal up unconfirmed.
Session highs fell just short of testing last week's high at 1114.50
before profit taking pressured the market into the close. If the
rally continues, the 50% retracement level of the May/September
decline crossing at 1137.45 is December's next upside target.

The Dow closed higher on Friday thereby confirming yesterday's key
reversal up. Session highs fell short of testing broken fib support
crossing at 9636. The new high close for the month keeps this fall's
rebound alive while setting the stage for a possible test of this
summer's downtrend line, which crosses near 9905 later this fall.

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

December bonds posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday.
Early weakness led to a jab below broken resistance crossing at
107-11. However, a lack of follow-through selling failed to
materialize, which triggered a short covering rally into the close.
Friday's new contract high close sets the stage for additional gains
into early- November and a possible test of the October 1998 high,
which crosses at 111-21 later this year. This week's rally has turned
the daily ADX bullish.

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed slightly higher on Friday due strength in gold,
fiber and some energy markets. The CRB is trying to carve out a
bottom just above the July 1999 low crossing at 182.67. Closes above
191.99 are needed to confirm that a bottom has been posted. The daily
ADX remains bearish but hints that this fall's decline may soon come
to an end.

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed mixed on Friday in quiet trading. Recent
talk that OPEC will cut crude oil production by as much as 750,000
barrels on November 14th has put a floor under crude oil and the
products for the time being.

December crude oil closed slightly higher on Friday as it posted an
inside week. Closes above 22.80 or below 21.41 are needed to clear up
near-term direction in the market. Daily momentum indicators are
bearish but becoming oversold while weekly indicators are bearish and
signal that new lows are still possible later this fall.

December heating oil closed lower on Friday in lackluster trading as
it ended its fourth week of sideways trading. Closes above 68.60 or
below 61.40 are needed to confirm a breakout of this fall's trading
range and point the direction of the next trending move. Momentum
indicators are neutral to bullish hinting that sideways to higher
prices are possible into early-November.

December unleaded gas closed lower on Friday confirming Thursday's
downside reversal. Closes below 58.25 would set the stage for a
possible test of last week's low crossing at 56.80. However,
stochastics and RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices are still possible.

December Henry Hub natural closed higher on Friday as it extends this
month's short covering rally and confirmed Wednesday's breakout above
the April/August downtrend line. Friday's high-range close leaves the
door open for additional strength on Monday as the seasonal trend
points to higher prices into mid-winter. Stochastics and RSI are
becoming overbought but signal that additional strength is still
possible.

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The December Dollar posted an inside day with a slightly higher close
on Friday thereby leaving Thursday's key reversal down unconfirmed.
December is at a crossroads having spiked above September's high,
which coincides with the 50% retracement level of this summer's
decline at 116.65. Multiple closes above this resistance level are
needed to keep this fall's rally alive. Closes below October's
uptrend line and Thursday's low at 115.45 would all but confirm that
a short-term top has been posted.

The December Swiss Franc posted an inside day with a slightly lower
close on Friday leaving yesterday's key reversal up unconfirmed.
December remains below broken trendline support crossing near .6082,
which leaves the door open for additional weakness this fall if
December can close below Tuesday's low at .5996. If the decline
resumes, the 50% retracement level crossing at .5944 is December's
next target.

The December Canadian Dollar posted an inside day with a lower close
on Friday as it continues to consolidate above this week's low, which
appears to have also marked a double bottom with the late-September
low at .6315. Closes above .6367 would temper the near-term bearish
outlook in the market and could set the stage for a possible test of
October's high at .6422 later this fall.

The December Japanese Yen posted an inside day with a higher close
due to light short covering on Friday. However, the rising ADX
signals that additional weakness into the end of October is still
possible. If the decline continues, the reaction low crossing at
.8090 is a potential target later this fall.

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

December gold closed higher on Friday as it extended its short
covering bounce off this week's low. Friday's close above the 62%
retracement level, which crosses at 278.10 has tempered the near-term
bearish outlook in the market while opening the door for additional
short covering into early- November. Stochastics and RSI are oversold
and turning neutral hinting that a low is in or very near.

December silver closed slightly lower on Friday as it consolidates
above September's gap crossing at 4.20. If this support level gives
way, September's low at 4.175 is the next downside target. However,
momentum indicators are very oversold hinting that a short-term
bottom might be near. Closes above broken fib support crossing at
4.294 are needed before a bottom is confirmed.

December copper closed sharply higher on Friday due to short covering
after failing to extend this week's decline below last Friday's low
at 62.25. Today's close at broken long- term support crossing at
63.50 hints that additional short covering is possible. However, it
will take closes above last week's high of 65.20 to signal that a
bottom is in place. Momentum indicators are oversold and turning
neutral to bullish hinting that additional short covering is possible
next week.

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

December corn closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead
of the weekend. Session highs tested the September/October downtrend
line crossing near 2.07 but was unable to overcome this resistance
level. Until this initial resistance level is broken, the door
remains open for a possible test of this summer's low crossing at
2.02 1/4 this fall. With the bulk of this year's corn harvest still
ahead of us along with the upcoming November supply/demand report,
upside potential near-term appears limited.

December wheat closed above key resistance marked by August's high at
2.93 1/2 as it confirmed Thursday's key reversal up. This week's
strong export sales report along with mounting concerns over flooding
in Argentine wheat country continues to underpin this fall's rally.
Multiple closes above August's high would confirm today's breakout
thereby setting the stage for a test of the 50% retracement level of
the January/September decline crossing at 2.97 possibly on Monday.
Momentum indicators are bullish but becoming overbought while the
daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) has turned bullish signaling
that sideways to higher prices into early-November are possible.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

November soybeans posted an inside day on Friday due to light profit
taking ahead of the weekend as it consolidated some of this week's
gains. With soybean harvest rapidly coming to an end, downside risk
appears limited at this time. Thursday's breakout above October's
downtrend line signaled that a harvest low might be in place. Closes
above the August/September downtrend line crossing near 4.36 are
needed before this is confirmed. This week's downturn by the daily
ADX provides added confirmation that an important low was posted
earlier this week.

December soybean meal closed higher on Friday due to light short
covering. Session highs fell short of filling this month's gap
crossing at 163.90 before a sell off ahead of the close tempered some
of today's losses. Friday's mid- range close leaves the door open for
a possible setback on Monday as December may try and consolidate some
of this week's gains. Longer-term, the door is open for a test of the
top of the gap crossing at 163.90 then October's high crossing at
167.

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

December hogs closed higher on Friday due to short covering ahead of
the weekend as the market consolidated some of this week's losses.
Additional pressure came from light position squaring ahead of this
afternoon's monthly USDA hogs and pigs report. This afternoon's snout
count showed the U.S. pig crop as of September was 8.56 million head,
slightly below the previous year's level. Sow farrowing during this
time frame totaled 964,000 head, 1% below last year. The average
litter size for September rose to 8.88 compared with 8.84 last year.
This afternoon's report had no surprises in it so traders will
continue to focus on demand versus supply for near-term direction.
Weekly momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to
lower prices are likely into November. The daily ADX is also bearish
mode and rising, which signals that additional weakness is possible.

December cattle posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on
Friday leaving Thursday's key reversal up unconfirmed. Gains were
limited as cash bids continue to run at a discount to futures prices.
Closes above the September/October downtrend line crossing near 67.50
are needed to confirm that a bottom has been posted. Stochastics and
RSI are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices
are possible into early November.

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

December coffee posted a key reversal down on Friday due to producer
selling as harvest is beginning in southeast Mexico. Session highs
fell short of testing broken long-term support marked by the April
1975 low, which crosses at 45.25. Additional weakness on Monday is
needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. Closes below
Monday's low would renew this year's decline while setting the stage
for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40- cents
later this year.

December cocoa posted a key reversal up on Friday following a spike
below the 62% retracement level of the September/October rally, which
crosses at 979. Additional strength on Monday is needed to confirm
today's bullish reversal pattern. However, closes above Wednesday's
high at 1022 are needed to signal that a short-term bottom was posted
with today's low. Stochastics and RSI are bearish but oversold
hinting that a low is in or near.

March sugar posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday hinting
that a short-term top might be in placed. A close below this week's
low crossing at 660 is needed before this can be confirmed.
Stochastics are bullish but becoming overbought warning traders to
use caution as a short-term top might be in or is near. If the rally
off this month's low continues this summer's downtrend line crossing
near 709 is March's next upside target.

December cotton closed higher on Friday due to short covering as it
posted a key reversal up due to its extreme oversold condition.
However, December remains below broken long-term support crossing at
29.50 cents. With December cotton trading at new 29-year lows,
additional weakness is still possible. The daily ADX (a
trend-following indicator) is still in a bearish mode signaling that
additional weakness near-term is possible.

0,"I attended the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association's Annual 
Post-Session Legislative Meeting, July 9 - 12.

Presentations were made by Louisiana Representatives Damico, Daniel, 
Montgomery, Pierre; Senators Barham, Theunissen; and Governor Foster's Deputy 
Chief of Staff covering the 2001 session, the upcoming special session in 
October and next year's ""Fiscal Only"" Session.

Although the vast majority of issues of interest to the industry were dealt 
with without much media attention, three issues - retail gasoline pricing, 
water policy management and the processing tax - received considerable media 
attention. 

Except as noted below, no legislation actively opposed by the oil and gas 
industry survived the legislative process.

The only setback for the industry dealt with legislation brought by an array 
of local government groups - police jurors, school boards, sheriffs, 
assessors and municipalities - in response to the continuing controversy over 
the parish property taxes paid by interstate pipeline companies. As part of 
the dispute, many pipeline companies have paid a portion of their taxes under 
protest - and that portion paid under protest, prior to passage of SB 1046, 
could not be budgeted or spent by local governments. While the passage of SB 
1046 will allow parish governing bodies to spend the protested taxes, a 
number of amendments offered by supporters of industry and taxpayer fairness 
were adopted that will work to assure that the taxpayers will get their money 
back in a timely manner if they prevail.

Although the Public Service Commission has the authority to open up the 
electric market to competition, the Legislature recognizes the importance of 
additional generation capacity and passed legislation urging the LA. Dept. of 
Economic Development to explore ways, including possible incentives, to 
encourage additional unregulated electric generation to be developed in 
Louisiana.

Water management received a lot of attention due to several plans for 
generating plants that would use groundwater (unlike Enron's plans to use 
surface water). SB 965 creates a Ground Water Management Commission that has 
the authority to define critical areas and regulate withdrawals in those 
areas. It also creates a Ground Water Advisory Task Force that provides for 
local and industry participation.

As far as the upcoming special session and the 2002 session are concerned, 
taxes will be in the forefront, including the much- dreaded processing tax , 
which would cost Enron about $50 million. According to the participating 
legislators and the Governor's staff, the processing tax is gaining momentum 
because of Sen. Foster Campbell persistence in bringing it up year after year 
and his promises that the processing tax will take care of Louisiana's budget 
problems. The industry will continue to vigorously oppose this tax.

Donald, Gavin and Jerry - I am sending you a summary of Louisiana Legislative 
Bills pertaining to the energy industry."

I wanted to check with you on one issue on the Midway pricing request 
currently at the desk.

The interruptible provision should be for the following profile:

 Years 1, 2, & 3 1,000 hours per year
 Years 4 &5 500 hours per year

This is the profile of allowed oil back-up operation under the project's air 
permit.

Is this profile consistent with the pricing request we discussed with Charlie 
yesterday afternoon?

Let me know.  I wanted to check this before they give us pricing back.

Fred Mitro forwarded an email you sent him concerning a legal question.  
Please be advised that Enron policy requires that all outside legal advice be 
coordinated through an inhouse lawyer, and certainly any legal advice given 
to Enron employees must be given to Enron counsel as well.  This requires 
some discipline on the part of our outside counsel, but we find it works in 
everyone's best interest.

Thank you for your attention to this very important policy.

Rick: 
        In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned about the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of NYMEX. A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.

        For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worried that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might follow.  In this scenario, Enron?s large NYMEX position could put it in jeoprardy.  As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX clearing falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NYMEX payment performance?????"

CONFIDENTIAL - - ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

To all, other than Richard, please do not forward this e-mail on to others.

Richard -

As a follow-up to your request for information in support of any possible 
legal action at Gleason, I'm forwarding the attached news report.  I have 
copied only the three principle people (Eric, Ben, Mark) involved in 
analyzing the complaints, gathering information in support of your legal 
research, and responding accordingly.

A few comments:

1.  A third party analysis (Southwest Research Institute - - SWRI) showed no 
abnormal noise within the hearing range.
2.  SWRI showed that at 25 Hz there is a louder than expected vibration.  
This is well below the hearing range.  There are no vendor, regulatory, or 
otherwise, specifications for vibrations in this range.  The fleet of 501 
FD's is too small to get any historical data on this range.
3.  SWRI indicated that one possible source could be the water injection 
system in the combustor.  We have informed the turbine vendor (Siemens 
Westinghouse - - SWPC) of this and asked that they work with us to resolve 
the following:
 a.  Is there a problem
 b.  If there is a problem, what can be done to completely correct the cause 
of it.
 c.  Barring (b), what can be done to mitigate the effect of the possible 
problem (damping material in the stack, etc).
4.  Since we instrumented and tested (by SWRI), we have not had significant 
run time.
5.  Mark Dobler and I are meeting with SWPC in Orlando on Monday of next week 
to hammer out the detailed plan.
6.  The run season is coming to an end, and I expect fewer than 16 total run 
hours before next January.
7.  We are working to resolve whether there is a problem, and if so to 
correct it; however, since this is a new generation machine, any efforts have 
to be coordinated with the OEM (SWPC); therefore, an expeditious 

My instinct is to explain to the press and the neighbors fully what we are 
doing, but I want to make sure that we don't put ourselves in any legal 
jeopardy.  Advice? I suggest a meeting with all concerned if you have 
significant comments/advice.

Return to index of stories... 	DEEP IN THE HEART OF AFRICA, ONE OF THE THE 
MOST  INTELLIGENT ANIMALS ON EARTH FIGHTS FOR SURVIVAL IN A REMOTE RAIN  
FOREST.
	THE ANIMAL IS THE BONOBO.
	SCIENTISTS HAVE THEIR OWN  NAME FOR THIS UNUSUAL PRIMATE.""THE PEACEFUL CHIMP.""
	LIZ  PURCELL TELLS US WHY THE NAME FITS IN THIS ENDANGERED SPECIES  REPORT.
	BONOBOS ARE UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRIMATE THAT EXISTS ON  EARTH. PHYSICALLY,
	THEY STAND OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR GRACEFUL BUILD  AND ROUNDISH FACE. SOCIALLY
	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY'RE  VERY PEACEFUL.AND VERY
	SEXUAL.PRIMATES.
	""LIKE CHIMPANZEES  BONOBOS ARE OUR CLOSEST LIVING RELATIVE. THEY WERE  ONLY
	DISCOVERED IN THE 1920'S AND IDENTIFIED AS A SEPARATE  SPECIES FROM CHIMPS.""
	WHILE CHIMPANZEES ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE  AND THEIR SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY
	MALES, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE OF  BONOBOS.
	""BONOBOS ARE EXTREMELY UNUSUAL BECAUSE FEMALES ARE  THE MOST TIGHTLY BONDED
	IN THE GROUP AND THEY USE THOSE BONDS TO  CO-OPERATE WITH EACH OTHER AND
	THEN DOMINATE MALES AND THIS IS  VERY RARE AMONG MAMMALS.""
	BONOBOS REJECT VIOLENCE IN THEIR  COMMUNITY. THEY USE SEXUAL ACTIVITY TO
	EASE TENSIONS AND SETTLE  DISPUTES. AMY PARISH MONITORS THE DAILY
	ACTIVITIES OF A GROUP OF  BONOBOS AT THE SAN DIEGO WILD ANIMAL PARK. THERE
	ARE FEW IN  CAPTIVITY ANYWHERE--AND THIS ONE OF THE LARGEST GROUPS IN  THE
	U-S.
	""AARON, KILI, COME HERE."" 
	ANIMAL  KEEPERS AT THE PARK FIND THAT THE BONOBOS ARE SO QUICK AND  SO
	INTELLIGENT THAT WORKING WITH THEM IS A REAL  CHALLENGE.
	""THEY'RE VERY ACTIVE CREATURES. THEY'RE  CONSTANTLY PLAYING, MOVING,
	FORAGING FOR FOOD.""
	BONOBOS  LIVE IN AN AFRICAN RAINFOREST IN THE CONGO BASIN LOCATED IN  THE
	COUNTRY FORMERLY KNOWN AS ZAIRE. THEY'RE ENDANGERED BECAUSE  THEIR FOREST
	IS BEING DESTROYED BY LOGGING COMPANIES. AND THEY'RE  HUNTED FOR FOOD. 
	FEWER THAN 20-THOUSAND OF THESE ANIMALS ARE  ALIVE IN AFRICA TODAY. THE
	BONOBOS, THEIR UNIQUE SOCIAL SYSTEM  AND THEIR HABITAT ARE UNDER ATTACK IN
	THE  WILD.

		 Subject: Fwd: CEA Update Bad News


Senator Gramm's staff presented to the Senate Ag Committee Republican and
Democratic staff and the Democratic staff of the Senate Banking Committee,
Gramm's proposed changes to the CEA bill. This proposal is quite lengthy,
and includes many amendments most of which were previously discussed with
the House Agriculture Committee, some of which were included in House
Agriculture Committee Saturday Night Draft of 10/8/00. Because of the length
of the document we have only attached the summary that the Gramm staff
provided. In separate e-mails to follow we will send only the pages of the
House-passed bill that were changed by the Gramm proposal. As you know  some 
of these provisions include matters objectionable to
Treasury, SEC, CFTC, Chicago and New York Exchanges. Essentially the Gramm
staff has included proposals which would allow retail and agency
transactions as well as language designed to solve the Blackbird problem.
As you also know the view of the Agencies and the Ag Comm is that  some of
these exclusions create loopholes which can allow some market participants
to avoid the new Single Stock Futures regulatory design, the CFTC oversight
of the energy market, and go far beyond the recommendations of the
President's Working Group.
The staffs of the Banking and Agriculture Committees have agreed to meet
tomorrow late morning. We believe at that time the Agriculture Committee
will propose a counter-offer which while addressing the Gramm major concerns
will not adopt his proposal but instead rely on the Treasury proposals. If
Senator Gramm is willing to work off this alternative a negotiation may
result, otherwise it is unlikely that any agreement with Gramm will be
reached. The Agriculture Committee is disinclined to repeat the debates held
in the House Agriculture Comm. consideration of the bill. We welcome your 
reaction to the proposal. If you have questions or comments
please do not hesitate to call Mary (973-5907), or George (973-5920). <<Gramm

LETTER FROM COLLEGE

An exact replica of a letter a daughter wrote to her parents
from college

Dear Mom and Dad:

It has now been three months since I left for college. I
have been remiss in writing this and I am very sorry for my
thoughtlessness in not having written before. I
will bring you up to date now, but, before you read on,
please sit down.

YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN.

OKAY! Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now. The
skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of
the window of my dormitory when it caught
fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I
only get those sick headaches once a day.

Fortunately the fire in the dormitory and my jump were
witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm,
and he was the one who called the fire department
and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and,
since I had nowhere to live because of the burned out
dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share
his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but
it's kind of cute.

He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and
are planning to be married. We haven't set the exact date
yet, but it will be before my pregnancy
begins to show.

Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are
looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will
welcome the baby and give it the love,
devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.

The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my
boyfriend has some minor infection, which prevents us from
passing our pre-marital blood tests, and I
carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with
the penicillin injections I am having daily. I know you will
welcome him into our family with open arms. He is kind and,
although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is
of a different race and religion than ours, I know your
often-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered
by the fact that his skin color is somewhat different from
ours. I am sure you will love him as I do.

His family background is good too, for I am told that his
father is an important gun-bearer in the village from which
he came.

Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you
that there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a
concussion or a skull fracture. I was not in the hospital, I
am not pregnant, I am not engaged. I do not have syphilis
and there is no man in my life.

However, I am getting a 'D' in History and an 'F' in Science
and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.

Yours,

Your Loving Daughter.

================================================================

SANTA CLAUS RALLY

U.S. equities are higher midday as some upbeat news in the 
retail and Internet sectors is giving equities a lift in the 
post-holiday session. Wal-Mart (WMT,59,f2&f4) reported it sees 
higher-than-expected December same-store sales while Internet 
portal Yahoo! (YHOO,18.03,f1) said sales at its shopping site 
increased significantly. U.S. Treasuries are trading lower and 
European markets are closed.

As of 11:46 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 
1.2% while the Nasdaq Composite Index is 1.9% higher. The S&P 
500 Index is up 1.2%. Oil-related and semiconductor shares are 
pacing the advancers while steel and toy issues are leading the 
decliners.

Leading retailer Wal-Mart is higher after the company stated 
that it anticipates December same-store sales growth at the high 
end of the 4%-6% range, exceeding its previous forecast. For the 
Nov. 23 to Dec. 24 period, Wal-Mart said same-store sales growth 
was in the mid- to upper- single digit percentage range.

Shares of Internet portal Yahoo! Inc. are higher on news that it 
saw an 86% increase in sales at its shopping site during the 
holiday season with ACNielsen figures indicating Yahoo customers 
spent $10.3 billion in 4Q.

Micron Technology (MU,31,f2) is higher amid continued 
speculation that the company is close to agreeing to an alliance 
with South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor (HXSCY,$9.90). A month 
ago, the two firms reported they were in ""exploratory"" 
discussions regarding strategic options, however, no official 
announcement has been made at this point.

Shares of EchoStar Communications (DISH,27,f1) are slightly 
higher after The Wall Street Journal reported that it wants to 
expand Hughes Electronics Corp.'s (GMH,15.02,f2) satellite 
Internet service. If regulators approve Echostar's proposed 
acquisition of Hughes, the company's chairman said he plans to 
spend $1 billion on Hughes' Spaceway unit and increase ownership 
in fixed satellite firm PanAmsat (SPOT,22,f1).

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

U.S. Treasury prices are lower across the curve midday ahead of 
tomorrow's planned $23 billion 2-year Treasury sale. In today's 
only economic release, the Redbook retail sales index recorded a 
4.5% decline for the three weeks ended Dec. 22nd, slightly ahead 
of Bloomberg's -4.6% estimate, with year-over-year sales 
declining 0.6%. Tomorrow, the Labor department will release 
initial jobless claims and on Friday the markets will be 
watching for consumer confidence figures, the Chicago Purchasing 
Managers' Index, new and existing home sales, and durable goods 
orders.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets are closed for the Christmas holiday. In 
economic news, the French producer price index fell 0.6% in 
November, twice the estimate, with the year-over-year figure 
falling a larger than expected 2.3%. The euro is flat versus the 
U.S. dollar. Crude oil got a boost following statements from 
Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi that OPEC will officially 
announce a 1.5 million barrel per day supply cut on Friday.

0,"As per my voice mail yesterday, EES is interested in having access to the 
IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and Altrade Electronic Brokering System for 
power.  EES would really need only read-only access, as all trades would 
continue to be conducted through ENA (or EPMI).  I believe the ICE agreement 
with ENA allows this type of access by affiliates, although we likely need to 
obtain additional user licenses.  I do not know whether the Altra agreement 
with ENA would allow for EES to access the Altrade system.

I think it would be preferable for EES to be able to access the systems under 
the current ENA agreements rather than entering into their own agreements, 
given that ENA will continue to be the trading party.  Thoughts?  Could you 
please advise as to how EES can get the access it needs?

Thanks,

0,"Between last night and this morning, I talked to Brian Coad and figured out 
what was going on.  The file confirms that someone in Risk Management put 
this deal on hold in November.  I talked to Jason by phone last night and he 
confirmed that this is what happened.  I had placed calls to Frost since 
working on the project but the lawyer did not rush to call since he has been 
out of the office until their business folks started pressing them this 
week.  So, I completed a legal review & figured out what the remaining issues 
are that need to be resolved with counsel.  (One of which was a convulated 
SEC issue that we figured out last night). I sent Brian a final draft and he 
is implementing those changes in a draft for his counsel.  His counsel is out 
of the office until Monday but Brian put us in contact.  I would predict that 
we will settle on the final terms on Monday, make minor changes to the final 
draft and get it executed by then.

Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers,But Still Trading
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. 
""It's not getting any better,"" said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. 
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. 
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. 
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. 
""They've been cut off from so many people,"" said one electricity trader. 
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions 

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. 
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. 
""We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility,"" Thode said. 
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. 
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. 
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating ""evolving."" Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.

USA: UPDATE 3-Dynegy says in talks on Enron merger structure.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp. over their proposed merger, as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some 40 percent. 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal,"" Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters. He declined to give further details.
Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is currently in a ""due diligence"" examination of Enron's complex financial books that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday. 
The buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about $10.41 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to near $4, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all. 
The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of 0.2685 of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to around 0.15 instead, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Enron is willing to accept the lower valuation, given the pressure on its stock price, the sources said. 
Enron's shares bounced on Dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks, trading up 22 cents at $4.23 in late afternoon action on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had dipped as low as $3.84 in late-morning dealings and as high $4.49. Dynegy's shares gained 4.7 percent or $1.83 to move to $41.08 on the NYSE. 
Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt past the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002. The sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $500 million in cash, which Enron has said it was seeking. 
There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which would be Dynegy's consolation prize if the deal fell apart, a source said. Published reports have said that investment banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans, and may dispute Dynegy's ownership if the deal breaks up. 
""The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized. There's a solid earnings stream from that thing,"" said one source familiar with the discussions. 
ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN 
Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off. Enron was not immediately available for comment. 
Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyout, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise. Enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactions with North America's largest energy trader because of credit concerns. 
""This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the principal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less then Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business,"" said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade. 
But as Enron's stock continued to lose value, down over 50 percent since Dynegy's initial bid, it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well. Enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $3 billion, from $60 billion at the start of 2001. (additional reporting by Jeff Goldfarb, Janet McGurty and Jonathan Stempel in New York).

Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky. 
Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.
Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion. 
The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said. 
As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion. 
Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer. 
But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way. 
Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy. 
Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
""There's nothing like accounting to scare people,"" said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron.

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price

11/27/2001

(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said. 
At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.
The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98. 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks. 
Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd. 
As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised. 
The current agreement with Dynegy contains a ""material adverse change"" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
""Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is,"" said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co. 
Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse. 
""The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars,"" said Gheit. 
If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd.

IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms
By Carol S. Remond

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.
And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader. 
Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal. 
""We're trying to figure out a good play,"" said a trader at a New York hedge fund. 
So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds. 
""People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it,"" a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, ""We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides."" 
Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price. 
Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. ""Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds,"" said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds. 
Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share. 
Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds. 
When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount. 
Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15. 
""A lot of the guys are still very skeptical,"" said a bond trader at a New York bank. ""But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds."" 
Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position. 
""We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive,"" the manager of a large New York hedge fund said.

Dynegy Confirms Talks On Enron Deal Structure - Source

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enron Corp. (ENE). 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal,"" said John Sousa. ""I can't elaborate any further at this time.""
An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment. 

Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report. 
Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%. 
Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share. 
The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion. 
While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent. 
Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron ""locked down"" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses. 
Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said. 
If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from ""pending""' or ""threatened"" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked. 
In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron.

The discussions between Enron and Dynegy aren't merely focused on revising the consideration Dynegy will pay. They are also aimed at providing Enron with additional funding and at restructuring its debt, said a person familiar with the negotiations. 
The moves are aimed at restoring confidence in Enron and relieving ""the perceived liquidity crisis,"" the source said.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says
2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's
Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action
today on the largest energy trading company.

     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings
communication, said although there was speculation in the market
that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take
any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.

     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's
credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the
energy trader in private equity.

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,
seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have
been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,
the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.

     ``I was approached by several people to invest in the
company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor
from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined
95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good
investment, he said.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.

     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,
jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its
stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks
between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction
convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take
place.

     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed
yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about
55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5
percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The
stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.

                        Declining to Invest

     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan
to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion
package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,
which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more
than two weeks.

     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that
invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle
Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people
familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to
comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We
are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''

   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,
which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong
American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her
portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.

     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy
is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of
Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less
than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the discussions.

                               Terms

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS
Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings
to 75 cents a share from $1.65.

     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of
payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in
cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit
rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

                           Cash Question

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right
now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not?''

     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due
this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from
lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million
credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he
was ``encouraged'' by the developments.



Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)


     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at
Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he
helps manage at Liberty.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday.

     ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy
deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just
waiting.''

     ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be
implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't
walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were
to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to
resuscitate Enron back to health.''



A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)


     St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and
doesn't own shares of either company.

     The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a
renegotiated bid, Heim said.

     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim
said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up
of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the
deal to have real value.''

Guys, it has come to my attention that there is some discussion to move critical retail risk management and structuring personnel (Rogers Herndon, Dale Furrow, Don Black, Bernie Aucoin, Edith Cross, etc) into NETCO before complete discharge of duties from the retail organization.  It is my expectation that this discharge will not occur until the all EES retail risk contracts are valued and discharged (termination or sale) in an orderly fashion that maximizes value to the estate.  After completion of this effort, these people will be available to the corporation to move to whatever effort you deem appropriate.  I would expect this to take the next four weeks.

US FERC To Order Sweeping Changes For Calif Pwr Market

Los Angeles Times, 11/01/00


USA: US FERC probe finds no Calif. market abuse by utilities.

11/01/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on 
Wednesday said in a report that California utilities were not necessarily to 
blame for last summer's price rises, which led to an unravelling of the 
state's move to deregulate retail power markets. 
A FERC staff investigation, which was to be released in full later on 
Wednesday, found California's market structure and rules ""flawed,"" which 
combined with tight supplies caused the price of electricity to rise to 
record highs in both wholesale and retail markets.
FERC has proposed rule changes to fix the operations of the California 
Independent System Operator (ISO) and Power Exchange (PX). The draft changes 
would eliminate the need for Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and 
Electric and SoCal Edison from having to sell into or buy from the power 
exchange. 
Other highlights from the proposal include establihshing an independent, 
non-stakeholder to oversee the ISO and PX; modifying the auction market; new 
reporting requirements; and accelerating new siting of power generation 
facilities and eliminating some environmental impediments to new plants. 
If approved by the full commission at its Wednesday meeting, the changes 
would become effective in 60 days. California regulators and industry 
officials have until Nov. 22 to comment on FERC's proposed changes.

US FERC To Order Sweeping Changes For Calif Pwr Market

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Wednesday proposed sweeping structural changes for California's 
problem-plague power market. 
The commission proposed the changes in response to a staff investigation 
report, unveiled Wednesday, which found no ""smoking gun"" evidence that power 
sellers in the state had manipulated market prices to financial benefit.
Instead, FERC blamed the state's mandated market structure for the 
electricity supply shortages and spiking wholesale power prices passed on to 
retail customers in San Diego. 
At the same time, utilities elsewhere in the state hemorrhaged hundreds of 
millions of dollars due to a state-mandated rate freeze that required them to 
sell power at below cost.

U.S. to Decide Action on State Energy Crisis Utilities: Regulators today will 
release plans for tackling electricity costs. Potential solutions include

The fate of California's rocky experiment in electricity deregulation hangs 
in the balance today as federal regulators meet to decide whether to 
intercede in the state's dysfunctional $23-billion energy market or to let 
free-market forces continue to wreak havoc. 
The four-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will release a 
long-awaited staff report analyzing the root causes of California's energy 
crisis and, more important, issue a draft order or action plan on how to 
solve the problems of runaway wholesale electricity costs.
During public hearings in San Diego in September, FERC Chairman James J. 
Hoecker promised that the commission would take action and ""do whatever it 
takes"" to repair California's electricity market, whose deregulation was set 
in motion by landmark state legislation in September 1996. 
Just what the report and order will say remained a matter of intense 
speculation on the eve of their release. The FERC commissioners could impose 
new price caps or order an overhaul of the California Power Exchange and the 
Independent System Operator, the state agencies that conduct daily auctions 
for electricity. The commissioners may ask the state to undertake new 
initiatives to foster more competition in a retail power market still 
dominated by the three big investor-owned utilities. 
But an indictment of power generation companies--which some in the state 
accuse of ""gaming,"" or manipulating the system to wield unfair ""market power"" 
and wringing excessive profits from customers--is unlikely, according to 
published reports and state industry principals and government officials. 
The FERC commissioners are said to blame market deficiencies and defects in 
California for a supply-demand imbalance that sent wholesale electricity 
prices skyrocketing in July to an average of 12.9 cents a kilowatt-hour, more 
than triple the July 1999 average of 3.9 cents. A typical residential 
customer of San Diego Gas & Electric, the first state utility to fully 
deregulate, saw his or her bills triple before state legislators stepped in 
to cap retail rates in August. 
Just as worrisome to many observers is that wholesale electricity rates 
remain sky-high today, even after the end of peak summer power demand. 
Wholesale rates in October averaged about 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, double 
the average cost a year ago, said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the 
Independent System Operator. 
In any case, billions of dollars of investments as well as the political 
careers of prominent California politicians could be affected by what FERC 
does. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is coming out from Washington to 
hold a news conference with Gov. Gray Davis in Sacramento this morning to 
announce new, unspecified initiatives to address California's electricity 
problems. 
The Davis administration has gone on record demanding that FERC, which 
oversees the transmission and wholesale selling of electricity around the 
country, to step in and discharge its legal duty to restore ""just and fair"" 
electricity rates in California. The ballooning of electricity rates in San 
Diego during the summer created a political firestorm that raged unabated 
until the state Legislature imposed its caps. 
Rates paid by retail customers in the Southern California Edison and Pacific 
Gas & Electric coverage areas are frozen as well for the time being. But $5 
billion in ""undercollections""--the difference between what the investor-owned 
utilities have paid for wholesale electricity this year and what they can 
charge consumers--looms overhead, worrying Wall Street. 
""I have no idea what the FERC will say,"" said state Public Utilities 
Commission President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee who says she is as much 
in suspense as anyone. ""But we are expecting a substantial order that would 
move the ball forward on repairing the wholesale market in California."" 
Consumer advocates and the state's major utilities would like to see FERC 
impose some sort of wholesale price controls--even gut the Power Exchange and 
the Independent System Operator because they are clearly not working as 
intended. 
""We expect some radical surgery,"" said Doug Kline, spokesman for Sempra 
Energy, the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric. 
Some consumer groups would like to see FERC declare the wholesale rates 
collected by generators ""unjust and unreasonable,"" legal code words that 
would open the gates to actions by the PUC or the Legislature to force the 
power companies to disgorge or refund excessive profit. Such an action, which 
would lead to litigation by the power companies, is considered unlikely. 
Business interests, including the power generators that have reaped enormous 
profit from the dysfunctional market, are arguing to let free-market forces 
prevail because restrictive price caps would abort the market's evolution and 
possibly stifle construction of new power plants, which offer the best 
long-term solution to the state's predicament. 
""We expect that the FERC will find that the high prices of this past summer 
are a result of supply-and-demand imbalance and market design defects on the 
retail and wholesale side, but that the market participants have been playing 
within the rules and that there has been no manipulation or gaming,"" said 
Brent Bailey, general counsel of Duke Energy North America of Houston, a 
major generation player in the California market. 
Duke and others also strenuously oppose a solution proposed by the state's 
municipal utilities, notably the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power: 
that the industry in essence be re-regulated by imposing a system of 
cost-based rate controls, similar to how electricity rates were set before 
deregulation. 
Such a move would lead to lawsuits filed by Duke and other power merchants 
alleging ""confiscatory"" actions by the state nullifying the value of hundreds 
of millions of dollars they have invested in California power plants. Bailey 
favors temporary price caps until the market regains its balance, as well as 
new tweaking of the power market to stir up competition. 
Los Angeles DWP General Manager S. David Freeman, who has led calls for 
temporary imposition of cost-based rates, said California's failed 
deregulation experiment raises the possibility that electricity is 
intrinsically an ""un-deregulatable"" service. 
""Three years ago, I thought it would work. Then we had a train wreck,"" he 
said. ""I'm not committing heresy when I say that I think it may not work out.""

Is it to late to change the Home Depot article. The issue with the county has
been resolved

Here is a revised version

""The developer of the Home Depot/ Target Center on FM2094 is proceeding on
plan.

The developers have requested that the Texas Department of Transportation
modify the new FM 2094 road to include three left turn lanes and a light at
Miller Road. The Water District has agreed to also include the new center in
their district as long as they pay any extra costs and meet certain other
conditions. The Developers have agreed to pay the extra cost for both
requests. The City passed a resolution to support both requests by the
developer and to express our intention to annex the property once the
developer closes on the property and makes an annexation request of the City.

The County and the Developers have also agreed to share in resurfacing part,
about 2100 feet, of Hanson Road- - a $200,000 cost. This is a significant
expense on top of all the other cost mentioned above.

But the project is proceeding as planned. The developers are still planning
on closing on the property in the next few weeks.""

El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share
HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG
<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today
announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,
an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share
of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding
for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second
quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million
in the year-ago period.
EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the
quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.
``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in
our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said
William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy
Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio
of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to
accelerate in the second quarter.''
For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share
increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first
six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding
non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515
million in the year-ago period.
Second Quarter Business Segment Results
The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the
second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year
and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas
and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating
significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced
trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale
customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's
off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed
to the record second-quarter performance.
The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT
to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher
realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the
reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for
the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and
$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from
the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day
and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.
The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,
nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due
primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with
the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March
2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion
Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.
Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas
Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared
with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost
savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3
TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement
filed in March.
The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million
compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in
Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's
investment in the Philippines.
Telecom Update
``We have made substantial progress in the development of our
telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.
Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,
we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant
Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building
businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant
Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the
telecommunications marketplace.''
Quarterly Dividend
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on
the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October
2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September
1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.
With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides
comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern
Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy
International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso
Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas
pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has
operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power
generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing,
and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso
Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging
the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion
and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the
completion of regulatory reviews. Visit El Paso Energy's web site at

    (a) Adjusted diluted earnings per common share represents diluted

Second
        quarter 2000 results exclude merger related charges of $(46) million
        pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.  Second quarter 1999 results

        $(86) million aftertax, a gain on sale of assets of $19 million
        pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the resolution of regulatory
        issues of $30 million pretax, or $20 million aftertax.  Year-to-date
        2000 results exclude the extraordinary gain on the sale of the East
        Tennessee and Sea Robin systems of $89 million aftertax and merger
        related charges of $(46) million pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.
        Year-to-date 1999 results exclude the cumulative effect of an
        accounting change of $(13) million aftertax, merger related charges
of
        $(135) million pretax, or $(86) million aftertax, ceiling test
charges
        of $(352) million pretax, or $(222) million aftertax, a gain on sale
        of assets of $19 million pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the
        resolution of regulatory issues of $30 million pretax, or $19
million
        aftertax.
    (b) Proforma diluted loss per common share reflects reported diluted
        earnings per share but assumes dilution.  Reported diluted loss per
        common share does not assume dilution because dilution would reduce
        the amount of loss per share.

How will the cutover work.  If a trader, operator logins in at the new building will the 800 numbers not follow.  If so then we will bring in an extra crew at noon to login and get set up in the new building with a planned cut over around 3pm.

person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

Justin - 

David Samuels and Rahil Jafrey have come up with an idea for an incentive to 
get people to use EnronOnline.  They want to set up a sports fantasy league 
system on the website allowing users to accumulate points and then awarding 
prizes to the winners.  The first proposal relates to European football (I 
think) and they would like to meet to discuss the idea at 10:00 a.m. Houston

Michael Salinas is planning the Christmas Card Signing Party.  It looks like it's going to be at Cabo's THIS MONDAY, December 3rd at 5:00.  

I assume that we will be splitting the cost, but I guess I really shouldn't assume because of everything the company is going through right now.  Michael estimates the total cost to be $1000, making your half $500.  Let me know what you think.

Also, are there any customers (for the trading side) that we need to be sure are included to receive Christmas cards?

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Subject:	XMS - Expense Management System Availability

Concur Technologies' Expense Management System (XMS) is now available to all ETS employees.  You can prepare your expense report, send it for approval, and transmit it for payment using the intranet.  It is more ""user-friendly"" than the previous Excel-based form and efficiently integrates with the SAP accounting system.  We request and encourage you to start using it.

System access on the Enron intranet:

To access the system, go to the Enron Transportation Services Home Page and type ""http://xms.enron.com"" in the ""Location""  field.  This will access XMS software.

Using the system, once accessed:

LOGON ID 
Enter your personnel number (P number).   If you don't know your ""P"" number, your ""HR rep."" has it!

PASSWORD
The first time you log in, the password is upper case ENRON.  The system will guide you through confirming your personal information and changing your password.  The Enron Code of Ethics prohibits the sharing of passwords and logging on as another person.  Please observe Enron's policy.  

If you can't log in to the system, go to the IT Central web page from the Enron intranet home page and select ""Services""
click ""Security Requests"" click ""eRequest""  (or call 713-853-5536).

OTHER
Once ""in"", the XMS system will help you get set up, including designating those who will be approving your expense report, and, if applicable, those who have been designated to prepare your expense report. Additionally, there is a ""tour"" that you can take to get acquainted with system features.

User Guide!!
Hard copy step-by-step documentation is also available from ""IT Central"" web page on the Enron intranet.
After getting to ""IT Central"" on the Enron intranet, click through the following and you should be there:
""Services"", ""Training"", ""Documentation"", ""XMS User's Guide"" (which will come up through Adobe Acrobat).

Application Support Services
Call the ISC help desk at 713-345-4SAP (4727). 

Accounting Coding 
No changes in coding are being implemented as a result of the transition from the Excel template to XMS, in fact much of the coding will be ""suggested"" by the XMS software. You will need a FAR #, cost center, or WBS elements as applicable.


GOOD LUCK!!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

0,"Ben,

I know you want to put Certosa Holdings on the back burner for a while but 
unfortunately we can't stop the process unless we withdrawal our request for 
unusual use permit.   If we do so, we can not re-submit for 18 months.   
Since the application was submitted in the name of Certosa Holdings, if the 
property is conveyed to another entity, it may be possible to re-submit under 
this new entity.  I've asked Kay to look into the possibility if throwing 
Certosa Holdings into bankruptcy.  I have not heard back but here are my 
thoughts:
 (1) We are not a creditor and therefore we may not have the ability to put 
CH in bankruptcy
 (2) If we can deem CH in default of the option agreement,  one of the 
remedies is reimbursement.  Since CH is illiquid, we would automatically be a 
creditor with the       ability to throw them into bankruptcy
 (3) Once in bankruptcy, I don't know what would happen.  There are no 
secured creditors and we would be the only unsecured creditor.  
 (4) Whether bankruptcy would halt the unusual use permit approval process or 
not, I do not know. 
Until we determine if bankruptcy helps, us we have no choice but to proceed.

I estimate the burn rate will be between $50,000 and $60,000 per month 
through October.  This is broken down into four types of costs:
 (a) lobbyists: $17,000 per month from June through October plus $210,000 in 
success fees if we get project approval from the commissioners.
 (b) yet to be negotiated option consideration:  $20k to $35k to Certosa 
Holdings as well as an adjacent property owner looking for a buyout
 (c) land fill closure related activities: $35,000 (ground water testing, 
fencing the property and funding assistance to get $800,000 of bond money 
released to reimburse       closure costs)
 (d) Consultants and lawyers: $23,000 per month

  
As you know we are now out of the jurisdiction of the CZAB and in the 
jurisdiction of the Board of County Commissioners.  Below is a summary of 
where we are and where we need to go.  Please let me know when you have a few 
minutes to discuss this project.

Renew or New Option Agreement:
We need to renegotiate the Option Agreement with Certosa Holdings:  Rather 
than giving CH a chunk of money that could disappear immediately, I'd like to 
structure an arrangement where we fund, as long as the Option Agreement is in 
effect (we don't terminate before expiration), some landfill closure work.  
This benefits both Enron and CH as DERM will be more amenable to amending the 
Consent Agreement that sets out the time table of closure if they can see 
some progress.  I an trying to get with Kay to discuss alternatives.  We need 
to be aware that CH could file bankruptcy sooner or later.  I checked the 
Option Agreement and unlike some of the other agreements, this one does not 
appear to have bankruptcy as a default.  If we have to give CH anything I 
would want to give him only a nominal amount of money;  $25k max

Option on adjacent property:
As referenced above, we (Kerri) have been contacted  by an attorney 
representing a property owner adjacent to the CH site who may be looking for 
a buy out.  The property is wetlands and should be relatively cheap 
considering it is useless.

Unusual Use Permit Application and Claim of Taking:
We expect to present the project and argue the taking issue before the 
Development of Impact Committee (""DIC"") in July.  This is a committee of 
County Department heads.  They will make a recommendation to the Board of 
County Commissioners who will hear the merits of the project and decide on 
whether to approve the project.  Only if they reject the project does the 
taking issue come into play.  I will work to target the Board of County 
Commissioners hearing for October.  

You are aware of the ordinance we propose to discuss with the Commissioners.  
I'd like to talk to you about this when you have time. 

DERM (Department of Environmental Resource Management) issues:
When we executed this option agreement, we fully expected CH to have closed 
the landfill by now.  Obviously things have changed.  

We (Kerri, Valorie Settles of Shutts & Bowen and I) met DERM last week.  DERM 
is willing to consider revising the Consent Agreement and the schedule of 
closing the landfill.  We discussed creating a 3 phase closure.  the first 
phase would be the easy (cheap) stuff as discussed above.  The second phase 
would be more expensive and may include removal of a pile of wood for $171k 
and or removal of exotics from the wetlands for $83k.  The second phase would 
be times to occur after we received County Commissioners approval for the 
Unusual Use Permit.  The third phase would be the very expensive stuff ($ 
millions) and would be timed to be when we expect to exercise the option.

Consultant Agreements for Lobbyists:
We have been working with one lobbyist, whose contract expired at the end of 
May.  Another, a former chief of staff of the commissionwer whose district 
the project is in, publishes a newspaper called the Gospel Truth, which 
recently published an article about the project and the need for power"

I will get on your calender in January when I am over.  It is also my 
understanding, for the credit trading business you are developing, that 
Chinese walls are not necessary.  But it will be necesary to address if 
equity trading starts up.  Also, there are probably related issues, like 
restricted lists and the like, that could apply to credit trading.  Hope you

UPDATE 1-Western lawmakers want Bush help with power

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Reuters) - Thirty-three Democratic U.S. lawmakers from 
California, Washington state and Oregon wrote to Energy Secretary Spencer 
Abraham on Monday demanding stronger federal action to help western states 
suffering from an ongoing electricity shortage crisis.

The lawmakers want a regionwide price cap for wholesale power prices to 
prevent hugely inflated prices and rolling blackouts this summer when demand 
intensifies due to air conditioning season.

They specifically criticized the Republican-led Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) for failing to maintain fair and reasonable rates, allowing 
generators to profit from power prices some 10 times historical levels.

""If political leadership were exercised today by the administration and FERC, 
California and the Pacific Northwest would already be on their way to ending 
the price-gouging,"" said Rep. Anna Eshoo, a Democrat from California.

FERC last week approved a number of price mitigation measures to tame the 
power shortages in California, but remains against a regional price cap.

The stance has drawn the ire of many lawmakers and dissent from FERC 
Commissioner William Massey, who says without such caps, the situation will 
not get better. Massey is outflanked on the commission by FERC Chairman 
Curtis Hebert, a Republican, and Linda Breathitt, a Democrat.

Experts in California estimate power supplies could fall some 5,000 megawatts 
short this summer on a daily basis, threatening the return of rolling 
blackouts to cut demand.

Eshoo is also the author of legislation to impose cost-of-service based rates 
in the Western energy market.

0,"Mark - I believe our Real Time group is sending your group a spreadsheet 
outlining all of the trades they do on behalf of EES each day. The first two 
deals - 544537 and 544544 - should be included in that sheet. The only deals 
recorded in the sheet I send are fixed price (and sometimes Dow Jones 
index-forward) day-ahead trades done by the EPMI Short Term California desk.

The third deal - 553219 - is in EnPower at the correct price of $133.23. The 
worksheet price was not updated from the day before, but it's been corrected.

The fourth deal - 553219 - again is a Real Time deal. It looks like it was 
entered on 3/19 for 3/19 HE 1. It's a deal for 25 MW, not 150 MW, at $175.00. 
I'm not quite sure why EES thinks this deal should be in for HE 1-6 on 3/16. 
If you have any more information, please send that along to Bill Williams III 
and me.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have anymore questions.

Thanks,
Kate

    308 Systems to Feature the Globalstar GSP-1600 Phone in TAC-PAK(TM)   H=
ERMOSA BEACH, Calif., Jun 5, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- 308 Systems, I=
nc., supplier of state-of-the-art remote communications packages, today ann=
ounced the addition of the Globalstar GSP-1600 phone by QUALCOMM to the 308=
 Systems TAC-PAK(TM), a battery powered, portable communication system inte=
grated into one small, briefcase-sized package. The Globalstar phone provid=
es a new way for people in remote locations to enjoy full office functional=
ity.   The TAC-PAK(TM) includes all of the equipment necessary for customer=
s to set up comprehensive worldwide command and communication operations wi=
thin 3 minutes of arrival at an incident. Options available in the modular =
TAC-PAK(TM) system include a Pentium laptop computer, cellular voice/data s=
ystem, color printer, copy machine, digital still/video camera, document sc=
anner, Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping and directions, videoconfere=
ncing, and much more. Now with the addition of the Globalstar GSP-1600 phon=
e, data cable and modem drivers (provided on a CD ROM), the user can establ=
ish two-way satellite communications for both voice and data.   The TAC-PAK=
(TM)'s compact size and portability enables customers to take full office o=
perations to the top of a building, the middle of a lake, or to streets blo=
cked by debris from tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other natural dis=
asters. Typical applications for the TAC-PAK(TM) with the Globalstar phone =
include remote office operations, major incident management, insurance clai=
ms adjusting, petroleum exploration, natural disaster recovery, search and =
rescue operations, Remote Structure Inspections, and related remote communi=
cation situations.   ""Putting the Globalstar phone in the TAC-PAK(TM) repre=
sents a paradigm shift in remote communications,"" said Mark Lueker, directo=
r of advanced projects at 308 Systems. ""Prior to our relationship with Glob=
alstar USA, what we were seeing in the field was a hodgepodge of communicat=
ion technologies which were impossible, expensive, or inconvenient for the =
typical user to integrate and operate in the field. Our company's original =
goal was to integrate the traditional office operations and communication c=
apabilities into a lightweight and fully functional communication system ca=
pable of being carried by a single person to a remote location such as a sa=
les meeting, construction site, brush fire, oil exploration site, or disast=
er situation. The GSP-1600 phone is a perfect addition to our product lineu=
p.""   ""The TAC-PAK(TM) gives our customers more flexibility and range in ma=

o the hands of people in the industries with the greatest need for remote c=
ommunications,"" said Dennis McSweeney, vice president and general manager o=
f Globalstar USA. ""The ingenuity of communications solutions by companies l=

breezy- and no rain to speak of.  sorry- had to rub it in a little.
anyways, got an email from marci's LA friend that i met while he was
visiting in london.  he is a producer working for animal planet doing
documentaries on dog shows, one of which took him to london.  now he's
coming to houston this wednesday for the reliant energy dog show, and
emailed me to let me know, since he's ""helping"" dad find the ultimate female
GSP.  so.....i emailed him bk, suggesting he try to meet up w/ y'all, that
you could show him the houston ropes, so to speak, and gave him your names
and phone #s.  kates- you already know jim from LA, and maybe marce has
already given him your #.  am not sure.  but anyways, he is really nice,
easy to talk to (even for moi, miss antisocial) and could be a fun night
out.  just wanted to give you  heads up in case some weirdo named jim casey
called and you were totally clueless....chat w/ you soon!  merci, little

0,"Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20

Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =

Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=

mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=

marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=

This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=

producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=
=20
Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=

groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=

Power-Market Bear Mauls Plans For New Generators In West
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The crumbling price of electricity in the western 
U.S., attributed by many to federal price controls, has forced power plant 
developers to cancel projects, calling into question whether there will be 
enough electricity to meet demand in the Northwest this winter. 
The cancellations of peaking plants and temporary, oil-fired generators - 
high-cost units that provide power needed only when demand is highest - have 
cut projected generating capacity in the Northwest by up to 1,000 megawatts, 
about 3% of the combined peak demand of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western 
Montana.
""The price caps have added uncertainty,"" said Scott Simms, spokesman for 
Enron Corp. (ENE) unit Portland General Electric Co. ""If we look forward to 
this winter and you see a diminished supply scenario, you can see why we have 
concerns about regional reliability. That could put us in a position of 
having rotating outages in the region."" 
About two weeks after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed limits 
on western power prices on June 19, Portland General halted installation of a 
new 45-megawatt gas-fired peaking turbine at its existing Boardman power 
plant. 
The utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers' 
needs and to sell some output to other Northwest utilities left short of 
hydroelectric supplies due to this year's drought. A turbine that size could 
power about 45,000 homes. 
""You can directly attribute that to FERC price controls,"" Simms said. 
After the FERC order, at least two utilities in Washington State ended 
negotiations with NRG Energy (NRG) for supplies from new plants that NRG was 
ready to build in time for winter. Both utilities - Tacoma Power and 
Snohomish County Public Utility District - experienced significant supply 
shortages in the past 12 months, paid very high prices in the spot market and 
had to raise customer electric rates by as much as 50%. 
But both utilities told NRG, and later Dow Jones Newswires, that they had no 
reason to sign long-term contracts to guarantee new supplies, because the 
FERC had practically eliminated the financial risk of relying on the spot 
market. NRG, as a result, scuttled plans to build peaking plants in 
Washington that could have added 300 megawatts. 
FERC's price controls, as well as supply-demand fundamentals, have 
dramatically changed the economics of selling power into the West's open 
market in the past few months. 
The current western U.S. electricity price cap of $98 a megawatt-hour covers 
the costs of generating power from easy-to-install but inefficient peaking 
turbines, but not the capital costs of buying and installing new peakers. In 
addition, the current price cap may soon be recalculated to a much lower 
level. The cap is based largely on natural gas prices, which have been cut in 
half since the cap was first formulated in June. 

Not Everyone Blames FERC 

The average monthly price for on-peak hours in the Northwest from August 
through March is $60 a megawatt-hour - a fraction of what it was three months 
ago. Many in the western electricity industry think that's because FERC's 
price controls have kept prices artificially low. A smaller group thinks the 
market is appropriately signaling that not all the planned gas-fired plants 
are needed, because some power plants are already under construction and 
consumers are conserving electricity. 
Jim Kemp, a senior executive for the Canadian utility TransAlta's (TA.TO) 
merchant power group, TransAlta (TA.TO), for example, doesn't attribute the 
cancellation of projects to price controls. 
""I see it as due to demand-side control and new units,"" Kemp said. ""The 
market is sending out a signal that we have enough. Maybe this winter we will 
find that we don't have enough, but that's not the signal the market is 
sending now."" 
The spot market for power has been far below the federal price cap for two 
months. Mild weather, a slowing economy and conservation efforts throughout 
the West have made power from expensive peaking plants unnecessary except for 
a few hours so far this summer. 
""Prices started to come down before the FERC mitigation plan started,"" said 
Tacoma Power supply analyst David Lucio, who was negotiating with NRG. ""The 
need to try to execute a contract wasn't as great with the prices falling."" 
Lucio said there should be enough capacity to get the Northwest through the 
winter, barring abnormalities like a long, extended freeze. 
Construction of dozens of peaking plants in the West is going forward in 
cases where developers sold supply contracts in advance. TransAlta is 
continuing construction of a 154-megawatt peaking plant in Washington, 
because much of the plant's capacity was sold months ago. 
""The number of announced projects is far and away more than what is needed 
within the time frame we're talking about,"" said Dick Watson, a director with 
the Northwest Power Planning Council. 
Still, several western utilities have asked the FERC to raise the price cap. 
Puget Sound Energy (PSD) told the FERC the cap ""undercuts the Commission's 
efforts to ensure adequate supplies of electricity."" 
As previously reported, some small oil-fired generators, which are even more 
expensive to operate than the permanent, gas-fired peaking plants, have even 
been taken off line permanently after being installed over the past six 
months. And orders for new generators have been canceled.

back in service.  We could be at 80% volume on Friday afternoon, but this is 
tentative.  

Also, the smart pig test run several months ago identified 4 potential areas 
that need inspections west of station 5.  While east of thoreau is down, 
these 4 areas will also be inspected.

Do not pass this info onto customers at this point till we have further 
information.  We will make a posting hopefully this afternoon.  Operations is 
also trying to combine some additional compressor work to this outage (i.e. 
grouting another unit and replacing some valves).  This work will limit our

Subject: Re: VEPCO PPA  

Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:
I haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times 
there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency 
power to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would 
want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to 
replace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get 
this agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).  
I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.
Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting 
transmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its 
network transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have 
to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the 
plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to 
supply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin 
Presto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's 
network transmission to delivery to third parties.
Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent 
rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While 
VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that 
you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to 
transmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only 
way to ensure deliverability to third parties.
3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an 
increase.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other 
sources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission 
and subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on 
best/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase 
daily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of 
receipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as 
non-firm.)
12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that 
has not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since 
FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant 
changes in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining 
transmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this 
contract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price 
covers that circumstance.
Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at 
most any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any 
current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will 
pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this 
contract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.

Subject: VEPCO PPA

Christi--

This is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively 
early draft of the PPA.

I think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and 
do the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.  
IN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up 
the regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue 
less contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at 
Rockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.  

Using the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their 
gas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas 
from the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the 
NCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think 
that we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply 
working on some of the siting issues.

That being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or 
Jeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there 
are some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.  

Thanks.

Lisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based 
on the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did 
encounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are 
noted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and 
are also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this 
goes to VEPCO.

Cover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be 
ENA or a special purpose company?

Definitions--  We included a defined term ""Emergency Start-Up"" (a start up or 
increase in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to 
include a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.

Section 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy 
charge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?

Section 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD 
will be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, 
it would be best to define ""commencement of construction"" to avoid 
controversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a 
placeholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is 
your preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific 
remedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that 
milestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would 
be a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 
days if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the 
cure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?

Section 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under 
this PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement 
to sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the 
Facility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take 
1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be 
pro-rated for the first year?

Section 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of 
Availability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the 
total hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated 
that the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other 
than due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled 
maintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be 
available.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated 
that a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why 
wouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we 
included language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during 
peak periods.

Section 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of 
Energy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we 
allow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?

Section 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.

Section 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?

Article 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not 
have any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do 
you want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for 
now?

Section 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or 
would you prefer a shorter period?

Article 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step 
prior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is 
""baseball"" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's 
position or the other's.  Is that what you want?

Section 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it 
will be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not 
recommend Virginia law for this contract.

Exhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please 
see the bracketed notes therein.

Please call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.

Hi Guys,

We don't expect to deal with the facility agreement until around 130, so
there isn't a need for Lee to listen to the rest unless he wants to.  Lee,
you are more than welcome to come in person, in which case I can give you
some exectued change orders.

Subject: El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings 
Per Share


http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000711/tx_el_paso_2.html

Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time
Company Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation
El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share
HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG
<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today
announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,
an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share
of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding
for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second
quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million
in the year-ago period.
EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the
quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.
``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in
our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said
William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy
Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio
of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to
accelerate in the second quarter.''
For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share
increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first
six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding
non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515
million in the year-ago period.
Second Quarter Business Segment Results
The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the
second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year
and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas
and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating
significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced
trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale
customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's
off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed
to the record second-quarter performance.
The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT
to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher
realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the
reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for
the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and
$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from
the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day
and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.
The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,
nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due
primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with
the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March
2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion
Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.
Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas
Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared
with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost
savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3
TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement
filed in March.
The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million
compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in
Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's
investment in the Philippines.
Telecom Update
``We have made substantial progress in the development of our
telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.
Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,
we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant
Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building
businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant
Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the
telecommunications marketplace.''
Quarterly Dividend
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on
the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October
2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September
1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.
With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides
comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern
Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy
International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso
Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas
pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has
operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power
generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing,
and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso
Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging
the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion
and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the
completion of regulatory reviews. Visit El Paso Energy's web site at

        earnings per share but assumes dilution.  Reported diluted loss per
        common share does not assume dilution because dilution would reduce
        the amount of loss per share.

0,"High Prices Force Chemicals to Sell Gas, Futures

Chemical companies, forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas 
prices, are nevertheless making money --- by selling gas futures contracts. 

Terra Industries and Mississippi Chemical Corp. became the latest companies 
to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs. 

Iowa-based Terra Industries said it had sold off a portion of its December 
natural gas purchases, and shutdown 50% of its Verdigis, OK, ammonia 
facility. The company had previously reported that it would not operate its 
Bytheville, AR, and Beaumont, TX, facilities during the month of December as 
well. 

In a similar maneuver, Mississippi Chemical Corp., a producer of nitrogen, 
phosphorus and potassium-based products in Mississippi, Louisiana and New 
Mexico, reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from 
January forward, in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered 
by soaring natural gas prices. Mississippi Chemical said it expects to 
realize a pre-tax gain of $16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending 
Dec. 31 from the recently sold contracts. 

The problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being 
mimicked by chemical prices. An overabundance on the market has kept chemical 
prices relatively low, while gas prices, a feedstock for some chemicals, 
continue to climb. The difference in the latest shutdowns is that the 
companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts 
off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products, said Ron 
Phillips of The Fertilizer Institute. 

Duke Energy's Ken Nyiri, divisional director of strategic planning and 
research, commented on Mississippi Chemical's transactions, ""I guess they 
probably made about a $4/MMBtu margin on the gas, which is significantly more 
than they could make on the ammonia; in fact, they would have lost $30/unit. 
Their ammonia was probably costing them about $205/ton to make (with gas 
bought at $5/MMBtu in November) and the market today is at $205 so basically 
they would break even on their ammonia production costs. By selling the gas 
at around $9/MMBtu they made $4/MMBtu. It was just a question of do they 
convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it, or do they sell the gas 
and make $16 million."" 

Michael L. Bennett, executive vice president of Terra, said, ""The natural gas 
price increase since our December requirements were purchased for Verdigris 
permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross 
profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with 
the natural gas. We will evaluate the economics of bringing Verdigris back to 
full production near the end of December when January's natural gas purchase 
commitments must be made."" 

Terra estimates the idled facilities represent 40%, 30%, 77% and 88% of the 
company's North American ammonia, UAN, urea and methanol manufacturing 
capacity, respectively. The production of all four chemicals are heavily 
dependent on natural gas. Phillips said ""The latest data we had in October 
was that of the companies that we survey, which is not the entire ammonia 
market, but a good bit of it, we were looking at operating rates of 76%."" 

Currently, a total of 4-5 million tons/year of ammonia production capacity is 
out of service out of about 20-21 million tons/year of production capacity. 
""Clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas [rather than 
producing ammonia],"" said Nyiri. ""It's the prudent thing to do, I think, in 
this marketplace. Buy your ammonia if you can. At $9 gas, that costs you 
$350/ton to make the ammonia, which is $145 more than the current market is 
willing to pay."" 

A spokeswoman for Mississippi Chemical said the company held on to its 
December gas contracts, and has been operating at varied levels of capacity 
throughout 2000 (see Daily GPI, June 30). ""Depending on what the gas prices 
are, and what our product prices are around the January-February time frame, 
we will make decisions then on our operations rate [capacity],"" said Melinda 
Hood, a Mississippi Chemical spokeswoman. 

Charles O. Dunn, CEO of Mississippi Chemical, said, ""We remain committed to 
the nitrogen business and our customers, but we also have to take advantage 
of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times. It is 
our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to 
be sustained during the intermediate term,"" stated Dunn. ""As a result, we 
felt it was in the company's best interest to sell our futures positions to 
lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas 
prices. Going forward, we will continue to determine operating levels for our 
plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices, nitrogen product 
prices and our customers' requirements, as we have been doing for some time."" 

International imports are also hurting U.S. producers. Currently, there is a 
surplus of ammonia in the international market, which is holding ammonia 
prices down. U.S. fertilizer producers can't compete with the international 
market. Gas prices are 46 cents/MMBtu in Russia, 50 cents to $1/MMBtu in 
Argentina and Venezuela, and $1/MMBtu in Trinidad. The U.S. imports 5.5 
million tons of ammonia each year. Fertilizers represent 80% of the demand 
for ammonia in the United States. 

Terra Industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it 
became economical again --- whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and 
methanol prices rising, just as long as ""prices reach levels allowing 
positive cash flows."" 

Nyiri said he believes relief is in sight. He pointed out that the ammonia 
market has been sitting around the $205/ton level for the last several 
months, but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next 
planting season. ""I've got my model peaking out around $250/ton in April or 
May and at that time I have gas costs coming down."" At that point, the 1-2 
Bcf/d of demand from the fertilizer production industry should begin 
returning to service.

for the below detailed project.   In order to fill in the blanks in the first 
paragraph
of Carol's template, it is necessary for me to know the appropriate section 
in 
each counterparty's Agreement that references the existing confirmation 
procedures 
(the ""Confirmation Procedures"").

Would it be possible for you to provide me with copies of the Master 
Agreements
for each of the following counterparties, so I can fill in the blanks and get 
these letters
out the door:

Bank One (formerly FNB)
Bankers Trust Company
Barclays Bank PLC
The Chase Manhattan Bank
Citibank, N.A.
Credit Suisse Financial Products
Elf Trading S.A
J.Aron & Company
Paribas
Phibro Inc.
Royal Bank of Canada

I would be happy to come up and retrieve them as soon as you have them ready.
If you have any questions, please give me ( 3-0443) or Joe ( 3-3316) a call.

Thanks - we're looking forward to being able to implement this procedure.

0,"Dan Watkiss argues that FERC has no authority to override the state, even 
though the rules go far beyond what is critical or necessary. 

Per Christi's thoughts, we may want to gauge Congressional interest in 
pushing something as an add-on to EPAct '92 that allows only safety / public 
interest reasons for an EWG to be restricted in its siting by a State.

I talked with Dan briefly about this to verify my conclusion that FERC would 
not get involved at this point.  The Florida issue seems similar to 
California (or any other state that has idiosyncratic siting issues) in that 
FERC has encouraged California to speed the siting of generation, but has not 
ordered it.  What I am not sure about is whether the possible DOE or 
Congressional emergency electricity legislation that Jim sent out yesterday 
(on demand side management payments) could also include language that would 
allow the federal government to override the certain state generation siting 
issues, such as the Florida law.

Christi, the Florida certificate process controls siting and licensing of 
generators.  Both are topics over which FERC has no authority.   
Consequently, FERC would have no authority to override the state.

Marchris --

Some things on follow-up from Ken Lay's call with Jeb Bush (could you have
answers by End of Week) -

1.   What is the process post the FL Supreme Court decision.  Did anyone
appeal to the Federal Courts?  Outcome of that action, if taken?

2.   Is it possible for the FERC to simply act to waive the CCN need?  Did
we ever discuss with FERC counsel the ability for that agency to ""override""
the CCN for any filing EWG?  What would they need to do?  Would FERC need
to take on the FPSC or Fla Supreme Court?  A state should have the right to
worry about safety and reliability, but not interfere with wholesale
competition.

3.   Have we calculated a ""back of the envelope"" $ value for the margin the
Utilities (FPL, TECO, FPC) will obtain by transferring generation at book?
I would think that nuke should be at book (this is a gimme) with the fossil
analyzed as the difference between average book ($/kw) and market value
($/kw - see Ben Jacoby).  What is the total $?

My understanding is that Steve Kean is heading into Florida to meet with
Sect of Environment next week.  We need to try and get a read from the
Utilities on how much $ would they be willing to give back in rate
decreases as a Generation Stranded Benefit to see this deal through before
the meeting.

Thanks,

Jim

Thank you for your prompt response to my phone call this morning.  Attached is a resume and cover letter for your review.  If you recall from our conversation Friday, I was visiting with Tony Vasut about positions on your power trading desk as an hourly trader.  The power desk is something I have been interested in learning more about for several months.  When you informed me of the current opportunities as an hourly power trader I was extremely interested.  I would love to meet with you or anyone from the desk at your convenience to discuss the opportunities in detail.  Please feel free to call at X58039, or reply to this e-mail.
Thank you again for your time.

0,"Elizabeth,

 Per your request, I have prepared the following summary.

Western RTO Development:

RTO West.
Area to be included -- WA, OR, ID, MT, Western WY, UT, NV-North & South and 
hopefully Canada (BC Hydro and possibly Alberta)
Filed with FERC ""Stage 1"" documents in October 2000 -- Governance, Bylaws, 
Draft of Operating Agreement, etc.
Stage 2 development begun January 2001 with of complete proposal in July 2001
Earliest practical operation Fall 2002 (optimistic based on quick on approval 
time)
Plan Quality -- Good overall 
Attractive Features -- independent board, single control area and real time 
voluntary energy market, all parties on same tariff, a tradeable transmission 
right with ""use or lose"" anti-hoarding provisions.
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to 
existing users for a ten year period (""use or lose"" will mitigate for short 
term rights but long term rights on existing system will be tough to get).
Desert STAR.
Area to be included -- AZ, NM, CO, Eastern WY
Governance established and Board has been organized.
Have not yet filed a complete plan 
Earliest practical operation Winter 2002 or beyond, depending on when they 
actually file their proposal
Plan quality --  Potentially promising
Attractive Features -- similar transmission right regime as RTO West
Unknown -- whether they will have a single control area, whether 
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to 
existing users, board selection committee was manipulated by publics (however 
in practice the independent board selected seems to have been little affected 
by the search firm nomination process)
CA-ISO.
Area included -- CA IOU's only
Fully operational but with CA/FERC jurisdictional struggle over Board 
appointment and independence.
Modifications to meet Order 2000 have been filed which appear to move 
transmission rights close to the proposals under discussion in RTO West and 
Desert STAR


Cooperative Regional Organization Activity:

Seams.
A joint task force of parties involved in RTO West, Desert STAR and CA-ISO 
began meeting in November 2000
Three major seams issues identified and work begun
Scheduling time lines -- aligning processes between three RTOs so that 
business across seams boundaries is not hampered for administrative reasons.
Nature of transmission rights and effect on loop flow -- making the 
congestion management systems work between the three RTOs.
Export fees -- goal is to eliminate pancaking of fixed cost charges between 
RTOs, perhaps by annual transfer payments between RTOs or some other 
reciprocity agreement.
RTG Consolidation.  
WRTA. SWRTA and WSCC voted to merge in to a single organization, the WIO 
(Western Interconnection Organization)
WIO will have three committee:   Planning, Operations, Market Interface.  
The Northwest organization (NRTA) has decided to stay independent for now, 
but if RTO West forms it may just disappear as a separate organization. 

If you need more detail, please let me know.

I am looking at a proposal, under which a Russian oil-major would be wishing

be interested to learn, whether Enron can purchase crude oil from this 
program (provided that we receive proof that it comes out of the UN program) 
and whether we are willing to do it (corporate policy).

I want to check that out first, before going forward. Next step would be to

		 Subject: California Update 3/06/01


Executive Summary
? If no comprehensive deal is reached by April 9th, chances of bankruptcy 
increase due to a one day ""opt-out"" clause in all long-term power contracts. 
? PG&E and State locked in tough negotiations, several issues on the table:
 PUC-imposed requirement forcing PG&E to ultimately be responsible for 
California energy supplies
 Price of the grid; state - 2.3 times book value vs. PG&E - 4 times book value
? PG&E will not use any of the $1B secured last week to help their ailing 
utility.
? Davis's announcement of long term power contract didn't include some 
details:
 Of the 8,800 megawatts secured this far, only 6,000 are available this 
summer 
 Some of the ""long term contracts"" are really only for three months
 None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot 
market
? One the same day Davis announced long term contracts, Davis also quietly 
announce a 10% rate hike.
? FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal.
 
PG&E
Transmissions deal
One thing that is still uncertain is PG&E.  Bankruptcy may still be a likely 
alternative if current negotiations to buy PG&E's share of the electric 
transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April 9 (when all long-term power 
contracts being negotiated have a one-day ""opt-out"" clause they can exercise 
unilaterally if a ""comprehensive solution"" has not been reached by the state 
and its major utilities).  According to sources close to senior PG&E 
officials, PG&E made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal 
on the transmission lines depends on the California government's willingness 
to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make 
until now. 

PG&E will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to 
relieve it of the PUC-imposed requirement to be the ""electricity buyer of 
last resort.""  Current state regulations make the utility companies 
ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all 
times to supply California's energy needs.  As long as the state steps in and 
makes those purchases, as it has for the past three months, the utilities are 
shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot 
market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings.  
But, PG&E officials are worried 1) this summer's supply and 2) Davis's 
concern over how fast he is draining the state's budget surplus.  If things 
get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state 
will pay only for the electricity it buys through long-term contracts, then 
PG&E will be left holding the bag. 

Thus, as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid, PG&E is 
demanding a ""comprehensive solution"" that includes not being liable for cost 
differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed 
to pay.  State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of ""get out of 
jail free"" card, so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough 
negotiations that are complicated by three other factors: (1) PG&E's public 
behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to 
encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy; (2) State legislative 
demands that the price Davis negotiate for PG&E's part of the electricity 
grid be no more than 2.3 times revenues from the grid; and (3) the FERC must 
""positively approve"" any grid purchase by the state of California. 

The principal concern on the price front is that PG&E wants to sell the 
electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their 
transmission, while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the 
politically acceptable limit.  ""We see 2.3 times book value as an absolute 
upper bound. There is no way PG&E will get more than that, whatever they 
think,"" according to the leader of one main consumer groups.  ""We are going 
to try to force any deals down to about 2.0 in any case."" Negotiators for 
Davis are also trying to 'proposition-proof' any transmission deal to protect 
against a later ballot proposal.  They think there are ways to do that, but 
not if the price of PG&E's part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative.  
Remember, if Davis's eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative, he will 
be running for re-election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed 
to overturn his solution.

On the Sacramento front - no one understands PG&E's motives
The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game 
PG&E is playing.  In a three day period PG&E made a series of announcements 
that left everyone scratching their heads. 
? Late Thursday, PG&E officials leaked information to California papers that 
they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity 
transmission grid to the state, which seemed like obvious good news, but then 
made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30% 
above what the state was currently offering.  While a deal can still be done, 
anything like the $10 billion PG&E wants would be very hard to get through 
the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase. 
? Late Friday, PG&E officials announced that they had secured a $1 billion 
loan for the parent company (not the electricity utility) and would use the 
money to pay off bondholders, other creditors and to return $161 million to 
shareholders in a new dividend payout.  Not a cent of that money was 
earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PG&E and that left at 
least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the 
utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood. 
? Over the weekend, PG&E leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay 
off its energy suppliers' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now.  For 
generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to 
start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy 
action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will 
""make them whole"" in a couple of months, that kind of trial balloon is 
extremely unnerving.

Thus, in a very short time period, PG&E's corporate owners showed they could 
access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they 
were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the 
energy crisis.  Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at 
least a part of the $13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer 
and PG&E's fund-raising will harden and deepen those demands.  As one senior 
political official told our source ""just when you think the corporate 
leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible, they 
come up with something even more outrageous."" 

PG&E's actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to 
construct to solve California's problems.  State Democrats doubt they will 
get Republican support for a deal, which means a vote will fall short of the 
two-thirds majority necessary for immediate enactment (resulting in 90 days 
for the legislation to go into effect).  Additionally, in the past 48 hours, 
many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less 
in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and 
may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the 
electricity grid.

Long-term Contracts - Davis didn't tell the whole truth
Yesterday, Davis announced that he had signed ""long-term"" power deals for 
8,800 megawatts of power, out of a total 12,000 megawatts he wanted to sign 
eventually. According to the press release, Davis is now 75% of the way 
toward his long-term goal and has already solved the hardest part of 
California's energy crisis. This means consumers would maybe pay more than 
necessary five years from now, but these contracts ""guaranteed"" that 
consumers would pay less for the next three years.  What Davis failed to 
highlight was that of the 8,800 megawatt commitment, actually only 6,000 
megawatts are available this summer (when demand is expected to 45,000 
megawatts); and some of these ""long-term contracts"" are actually only good 
for three months.  None of these contracts, however, keep California from 
having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market.

Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year
While the media was concern with Davis's announcement of long term contracts 
for California, of less concern to the media was Davis's quietly announced a 
decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers. The state will 
accept the 10% emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a 
permanent increase as well as an additional 10% increase for consumers that 
will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires. 
That would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour. 

FERC
The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve 
it in a positive vote. Senior California officials and legislators doubt that 
FERC has jurisdiction, and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal. But 
they may be wrong. ""The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs 
off on the deal. Its power over transmission deal is absolute, no matter what 
anyone says,"" according to source close to the President. There are three 
possibilities: 1) FERC could ""pocket veto"" it by not even putting it on 
agenda for discussion; 2) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted 
down. The Democrat on the commission, William Massey, has already said he is 
opposed to it; or 3) the Commission could approve it but with condition that 
Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system.

One complicating factor in the FERC decision, however, is that its chairman 
Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale, may not 
be around long enough to have his say. ""Hebert is definitely not a shoo in 
for the FERC chairman position,"" says one Washington official. Two other 
appointments to the Commission will soon be named, this official notes, and 
one of them ""could easily become chairman.""

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

James O'Keefe"

"
0,"Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. ""A"" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a ""must pass"" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is ""at least 
three years away from happening.""

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

If you look at the stc(sent to c-party)-dcaf tab, you will notice that the 
numbers are decreasing due to amendments
being signed by counterparties for negative confirmations.

Once we move forward with the new financial spreadsheet, I'm confident that 
we will see the financial
numbers decrease as well.

I'd like to meet once before you leave if possible to wrap-up our discussions 
on a few critical counterparties
which were close to an agreement with us including Morgan Stanley (who were 
not signing confirms and were
sending back there own form of confirmation which wasn't allowed)

Thank you,

Hi,
Jeff asked me to forward the new report to you.

Here is the format of the new report and a brief description of each tab:

1. formerage-Willie's prior aging schedule. Do we want to see this for each 
c/p? I think it would be helpful
2. aging-Current aging schedule by year
3. STC-Dcaf-Current physical STC information from Dcaf
4. STC-Tagg-Current physical STC information from tagg
5. financial-Current and new format. If you move the lower bar to the right 
of the gray boxes, you will see the new columns
     which we've discussed.

I completed the master agreement column from the Lotus Notes database;

We are currently waiting on credit for the exposure information and their 
assessment (e.g. 'credit concern', 'good credit', etc.);

Tagg is able to provide term information for each counterparty, but since it 
is a time-intensive process, Ron Nolte is looking
into adding a button in tagg that will allow this and/or create a special 
customized ongoing report;

I am in the process of completing the remaining two columns (i.e. do they 
sign confirms?, if they don't, reasons why?)

Overall, I think that this new format, including my proposed aging schedule, 
will be a valuable 'tool' for all involved in our
follow-up work. 

Thanks
David

Please keep in mind that we are not basing our decision on which 
counterparties to contact solely based on exposure and credit concern 
information, but rather based on all of the categories that Mark Taylor and I 
have asked you to compile with respect to each counterparty so I don't want 
the exposure numbers to be limited to any particular type of counterparty.

Hi,
I don't know how this was settled between Carol and Russell, and  I don't 
understand why Russell would not
want to provide this exposure information to us.

As we discussed earlier last month, I think it would be good to select a 
date, let's say July 5th in this case, and then go forward.

I like your idea of identifying whether the c/p is a 'credit concern' or a 
'good credit', perhaps this could be listed in the 'status' column
on the following spreadsheet.

I have attached a list of updated counterparty names.


Thanks

Subject: Re: Project  

How did things get settled between Carol and Russell?   Looking over the 
spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which 
counterparties we consider ""Credit Concerns"", where you would then prioritize 
on your end.  Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we 
consider them to be ""Good Credits"" (for example Duke).  Once again, financial 
exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next.  
Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated 
for more than a week, at the max.

Let me know how you want to go about this.  I think if I highlight which 
counterparties we feel you should look into, this would go a lot faster.

"
0,"In the final analysis, we did not make a lot of progress in reaching 
agreement to settle the RP99-507 proceeding on El Paso's capacity allocation 
proposal at the conference in San Francisco last week.

The parties have agreed to proceed on a dual track because of Burlington's 
concerns about timing.  We will  reconvene for settlement discussions July 12 
and 13 at Southwest Gas's offices in Las Vegas after comments and reply 
comments are filed as permitted under the procedures agreed to at the May 2 
technical conference at FERC.  Comments are due June 30 and reply comments on 
July 7.  Amoco and Burlington filed the original complaint on September 21, 
1999, and requested fast-track processing under the Commission's new 
complaint procedures.  Burlington is pushing to have the Commission adhere to 
the fast-track processing of the complaint, maintaining that an order should 
have been issued within 240 days (I don't know where they got that from -- I 
can't find any such requirement), and vehemently opposed any attempts to 
extend the procedural schedule.

The tone of the meeting was set when Harvey Morris, representing the CPUC, 
was allowed to make a statement because he had to leave by 1:30 (the meeting 
started about 12:30).  He started by saying that the CPUC was in complete 
opposition to the Settlement Proposal circulated by El Paso on June 6, and 
then outlined all the reasons it was unfair to California shippers and was in 
violation of the '96 Settlement.  

After Harvey spoke, El Paso then reviewed its June 6 settlement proposal, 
which you received by e-mail, and provided some additional explanations of 
assumptions, etc.  Then the parties met in individual groups to caucus on 
their positions and reconvened as a group to discuss. 

Of particular note was the allocation of the 360 MM/d of San Juan-only 
capacity that El Paso proposed to take back from Burlington (97J4) and Amoco 
(97JB).  El Paso said that it had been allocated 106 MM to the Havasu 
shippers, 180 MM to the EOC shippers, and 74 MM to all others (California CD 
shippers).  This was a major point of contention in most of the ensuing 
discussions -- California shippers objected to EOC getting the lion's share 
of the additional San Juan capacity.  Under El Paso's proposal, EOC shippers 
would get 82% of their rights from San Juan and 18% from Permian, based on 
BDs.  CD shippers, on the other hand, get 61% and 39%, respectively.

EOC shippers pointed out that the BDs were not actually representative of 
their load.  BDs were simply a number negotiated among the EOC shippers to 
allocate the costs that were allocated between EOC and California in the '96 
settlement.  Certain EOC shippers suggested that their specified rights 
should be based on some other calculation, such as non-coincident peak day 
usage, rather than BD.

Another major issue was the proposal that full requirements shippers (FR 
shippers) be given systemwide receipt point rights in addition to the 
specified rights they would get based on their billing determinants (BD).  El 
Paso proposed that these systemwide rights would have a scheduling priority 
superior to that of a CD shipper using its capacity on an alternate firm 
basis (either alternate receipt/primary delivery or alternate 
receipt/alternate delivery).  Of course, the FR shippers approved of the 
proposal but most other parties  objected to it.  Several suggestions were 
advanced to try to reach a compromise (for instance, limiting FR shippers to 
primary specified receipt point rights during Cycle 1 nominations), but none 
were accepted.  Most non-FR shippers stated concerns about the practical 
impact of giving FR shippers such a scheduling priority, particularly since 
El Paso's interpretation was that the FR shippers would not have to nominate 
any of their Permian specified rights in order to come back to the San Juan 
with  the systemwide rights.

Everyone pretty much agreed that El Paso's proposal for capacity release of 
receipt point rights (#4 in their write-up) was a non-starter.  It was put on 
the table to address an earlier suggestion by EOC shippers that, if they 
could be made economically neutral to using non-San Juan points, they might 
be more receptive to some restrictions on their specified rights.  What they 
were looking for was some discount for using Permian and there was some 
further discussion along those lines but El Paso was not receptive, stating 
that such would mean opening the allocation of costs in the rate case.

A third issue was who gets what rights at SoCal/Topock.  SoCal Gas doesn't 
consider El Paso's proposal not to sell Block II turned-back capacity to its 
Topock point to be of much value since FERC has said they can't anyway.  
SoCal Gas is looking for a right to get out of any of its contract for which 
it cannot get a specified delivery point of SoCal/Topock.  However, SoCal Gas 
can't at this point commit to the group a number that it could live with as a 
specified right at Topock.  Conversely, all the other CD shippers who think 
they bought firm rights at SoCal/Topock are not willing to see SoCal Gas get 
all the rights unless they, too, can get out of their contracts.

Fuel was the other contentious issue that seems to be a key sticking point 
for certain parties -- some insist it has to remain in the settlement, others 
say there can't be a settlement if it stays in.  El Paso's proposal would 
move the fuel rate back to 4.85% effective 2/1/00 by changing the way they 
eliminate fuel used in facilities that have been refunctionalized as 
gathering.  In the filing to be effective 2/1/01, the rate would go down to 
approximately 4.4% and then to 3.88% on 1/1/03.  Burlington insists they will 
opt out of the settlement if they don't get relief on fuel.  Apparently, to 
the extent El Paso doesn't include the costs of compressors that Burlington's 
gas utilizes in systemwide fuel, they have to pay a higher fuel rate to El 
Paso's gathering affiliate.  They say it has already cost them several 
million dollars (I heard numbers between $9 and $27 million -- no hard data), 
and they will not settle without getting something in return.  

After the full group discussion and statements of position on Monday 
afternoon, Rick Miles, the FERC ADR facilitator, pushed for individual 
meetings between the various segments (EOC, California, producers, marketers, 
El Paso), based on several parties' representations that they were willing to 
continue talking.  A schedule was worked out and the individual meetings took 
up the morning on Tuesday.  Just before lunch, the entire group got back 
together and accepted Mr. Miles' suggestion that each segment select three or 
four representatives who would then engage in a full discussion of the 
issues.  He felt that with a smaller group it might be easier to reach some 
understandings.  However, it apparently didn't work because he called us all 
back late in the afternoon for a full group discussion, where the positions 
outlined above were stated and restated.  Certain parties, when pressed, 
could not agree to certain basic principles because, they said, they would 
have to get input from others in their organization.  Mr. Miles expressed his 
frustration that parties were at the table who didn't know what their bottom 
line position was (e.g., SoCal Gas, Southwest Gas).  Following discussion by 
the producers, particularly Burlington, as noted above that they would not 
agree to an extension of the date for filing comments, the next settlement 
meeting was scheduled after the filing dates.  Mr. Miles requested that 
parties send him an e-mail note that would state their bottom line settlement 
position, which he would keep confidential.  He would review all the 
positions and to the extent possible put then together and float a settlement 
package of his own.  He assured all that no one would be able to identify the 
individual positions from his package.

One positive note at this meeting was that there was no conflict over the 
pooling committee's report.  No one registered any complaints, although a few 
parties who had not been at the last settlement conference indicated that 
they would like to participate.

 This is how I see our bottom-line position.  I would like to send it to Rick 
late this week if everyone agrees.

A pooling procedure that will follow assigned priority rankings for both 
market and supply with no restrictions on pool-to-pool transfers (loops 
allowed).
Only San Juan receipt point rights on our Havasu contract, or, preferably, 
termination of the contract so that the San Juan rights could be allocated to 
others as part of a settlement.
Full requirements shippers systemwide rights above their specified point 
rights would not have a higher priority than CD shippers using alternate 
delivery points, although no objection to using some allocation method other 
than billing determinants, such as peak day volume, to establish those 
specified point rights. 

Do you have any opinion about the allocation of SoCal/Topock rights?  Please 
give me a call when you've had a chance to look this over.  I'm sure you'll 
have some questions!  Also, we'll need to talk about what kind of comments we 
want to file."

Dog Fight

George and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all.  They sat down 
and decided to settle the whole dispute with one big dog fight.  They agreed

that they would have five years to breed the best fighting  dogs in the 
world and whosever dog won would be entitled to dominate the world.

Osama and his dog handler Mohammed found the biggest, meanest Dobermans and 
Rottweilers in the world, then bred them with the biggest, meanest Siberian 
wolves they could find. From the litters, they selected the biggest and 
strongest puppy and trained it day and night to fight to the death.

After five years Osama and Mohammed came up with the biggest, meanest dog 
the world had ever seen.  It's cage needed steel bars that were five inches 
thick and nobody could get near it.

When the day came for the dog fight, George and his dog handler Boudreaux, 
showed up with a nine foot long Dachshund.  It was the strangest looking dog

anyone had ever seen.  Boudreaux said it was a Cajun Dachshund.

Everyone felt sorry for George and Boudreaux because they knew there was no 
way that this poor excuse for a dog could possibly last 10 seconds with 
Osama's big, mean animal.

When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund slowly came out of it's cage, 
wagged it's tail, then waddled over towards Osama's dog.

The Doberman/Rottweiler/Wolf snarled and leaped out of it's cage,then 
charged the poor Dachshund.  But when it got close enough to bite the 
Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened it's mouth and ate Osama's dog in one

bite. There was nothing left at all of the snarling beast.

Osama came up to George and Boudreaux shaking his head in disbelief.  ""We 
don't understand how this could have happened.  We had our best people 
working for five years with the biggest, meanest Dobermans and Rottweilers, 
and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves in the world.  How did you do this?""

""Da's easy"", said Boudreaux, the Cajun.  ""We 'ad our bess plasic surgins 
workin' fo' five year for to make dat alligator look like a weenie dog.""

   Jeff and Greg:

   Echoing Jason's message from last week, we enjoyed

   meeting you very much.? With this email I would like

   to follow up on comments you made regarding a possible

   investment that would allow FairAir to serve in a

   market-making role.

   As detailed in the attached presentation, we propose

   that Enron invest $3.5 million for 17% of our company

   as the lead investor in a $6 million round.? These funds

   would let us deploy $2 million toward market-making

   and grow our business over 12 months to the point

   where we are generating $250k in monthly profits.

   (Our projections are detailed in the attached

   spreadsheet.)

   FairAir is the industry's best hope for the creation of

   a true travel market down the road.? Now that our system

   is operational, we are poised for growth.? As we discussed,

   Northwest has verbally committed to expanding from seven

   trial markets to their full route system.? Additionally,

   in direct conversations with American and Continental,

   we received a strong indication that an investment from

   Enron would tip the balance in our favor.

   I will call you the morning of Monday, March 26th to

   follow up on this email.

0,"Hi, Ken!

I just received a call from Chris Croom who wants to send an updated ISDA draft to Avery Dennison Corp.  Can we use the same credit, or do you want to revise it?  He said he was going to meet with the counterparty on Tuesday, so I'm sure he either wants them to get the draft before then or he will take it with him.

Thanks!

	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should

	- Each course is limited to eight students
	- Meets once a week for eight weeks

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",

Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed

0,"I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

case , but as we found out, I haven't..  Again , please accept my apology.  I 
just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.  It is  so  
difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that 
still doesn't see value in you.  But, that is my problem not yours.

 Have you a chance to look into this?  We are required to clear intercompany 
variances by the end of the month, so it would help if you could research 
this as soon as possible.  Thanks for your help.

Stacy,

 I have an intercompany deal which I am missing one side of.  HPL purchased 
gas from Dynegy (deal 96378) and sold to ENA (deal97185) on Oasis Pipeline 
(meter 1335).   I can't find ENA's purchase from HPL.  Please let me know 
what  you find out.  This is affecting our intercompany report and we need to 
have it cleaned as soon as possible. Thanks

are due on Tuesday, January 2.  Dan Watkiss has spoken to the FERC attorneys 
who will be answering the Petition, and he is comfortable that FERC will be 
able to adequately defend FERC against the Petition.  Additionally, Sue Mara 
will contact IEP to see if they will be responding to the Petition, and I 
have a call in to EPSA to see if they will be responding.  Therefore, because 
the responses seem to be adequately covered, and to keep Enron's name out of 
the headlines, we do not plan on responding separately to the Petition.

If you have any comments or questions, please let us know.

On December 26, SoCalEd filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus against FERC 
regarding FERC's December 15 order, asking the Court of Appeals for the D.C. 
Circuit to direct FERC to establish and order ""just and reasonable cost-based 
rates"" for sales in the California ISO and PX markets.  SoCal requests that 
the Court act by January 5.

SoCal argues that its lenders have said that unless FERC acts immediately to 
""restore creditor confidence"" in SoCal's ability to repay its loans, that 
SoCal will not be able to access additional funding, so that by mid-January 
SoCal will be unable to buy electricity, resulting in rolling blackouts to 
its customers.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like a faxed copy of 
the petition.

Vince-

Good news. Martin's box is working wonderfully- I'll have everything transferred to it and give him the keys by Friday.

This was (another) nice deal for Enron. We save $21,000 in real money this way, the cash refund Sun is giving Enron for our other server, using a box that wasn't being used by anyone. I'm happy about this.

I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in 
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me

whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the market

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Dear Danny 

We have had extensive discussions with Rabo concerning deal mechanics, and 
the relevant documentary issues.? Here is a summary of the salient points, 
none of which should hopefully be problematic:

1.????? Notwithstanding the structural logic, Rabo are not keen to purchase 
Psyche (the feeling is that it would cause all kinds of internal problems, 
and might disturb the credit process which to date is running smoothly).? As 
such, we should revert to the original idea of payments to Psyche by Heracles 
being irrevocably assigned to RBC, who will then assign them to? Rabo as a 
part of our deal with them.? We note that as currently drafted, the payments 
by Heracles to Psyche would still take place.? It would obviously be 
preferable if Heracles could be directed to make payments directly to RBC.? 
Alternatively, EAH would need to sign a direction on day one (as Member of 
Psyche) that all payments received from Heracles should be paid to RBC.? We 
understand that EAH would give a charge over the Member Interest of Psyche in 
favour of RBC.

2.????? The Sales Agency Agreement should lapse, as it currently allows. 

3.????? In its place, either a version of the old clause 6.07 should be 
reinserted into the Aeneas LLC agreement, or a new Sales Agency Agreement 
would be struck with Rabo, in either event stipulating a mandatory sale of 
the EOG shares (under Rule 144) in the event of either a failed auction, or a 
valid auction with Rabo as winning bidder.? There would be no other trigger 
events (ie no necessity for Enron to be downgraded). 

4.????? Rabo will negotiate directly with ENA/Enron on the EOG market swap, 
and ISDA. 

5.????? Rabo and RBC will negotiate as between themselves on the TRS and 
ISDA. 

At present, we are all shooting for execution on Jan 15th.? 

Kind regards 

David Bermingham

Subject: Re: Cerberus 

Attached are first drafts of the following documents to be used in 
connection with the insertion of an insurance company into the 
transaction: (1) Assignment and Waiver Agreement, (2) Swap Confirmation 
between the Agent and the Insurance Company (blacklined against the 
current Cerberus Swap Confirmation) and (3) Instrument of Assignment 
whereby Aeneas will assign the balance of its note to RBC (blacklined 
against the Assignment executed on November 30, 2000). 
? 
With regard to the Swap schedule to be entered into between the Agent 
and the Insurance Company, it would be helpful to know whether RBC and 
the Insurance Company have entered into any recent Swap transactions so 
we can follow the general provisions. 
? 
I believe that RBC was going to produce a draft Swap confirmation for 
the Swap to be entered into between ENA and the Insurance Company, but 
please could RBC confirm.? It also would be helpful to see an example of

We have to get together soon.  Did I tell you that I'm going to Vegas in

such as yourself deserves and needs a much bigger tv then what you have.  I
mean, really.  I think that you should sell the tv back to me for $100 (or
free if you're feeling generous :) and buy yourself a much bigger, more
manly, 26 or 32 inch tv.

   Word of the Day for Saturday March 23, 2002:

   forlorn \fur-LORN; for-\, adjective:
   1. Sad and lonely because deserted, abandoned, or lost.
   2. Bereft; forsaken.
   3. Wretched or pitiful in appearance or condition.
   4. Almost hopeless; desperate.

     Henry  had  felt  guilty  at  abandoning his sister; he had
     married not once but twice, leaving Rose forlorn.
     --Anita Brookner, [1]Visitors

     In  these  forlorn regions of unknowable dreary space, this
     reservoir  of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the
     accumulation  of  centuries  of  winters,  glazed in Alpine
     heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the
     multiplied rigours of extreme cold.
     --Francis  Spufford,  [2]I  May  Be  Some Time: Ice and the
     English Imagination

     Bloch  remembers  that  Stephen  was  a  member of the Milk
     Squad,  comprised  of  children who were considered to need
     extra  nutrition,  and early photographs do show him as one
     of the smaller boys, in the front row, looking forlorn.
     --Meryle Secrest, [3]Stephen Sondheim: A Life
     _________________________________________________________

   Forlorn  comes  from Old English forleosan, ""to abandon,"" from
   for- + leosan, ""to lose.""

Q. What is the most likely approved methodology for calculating the PX credit after Jan 18?

A.  The utility's weighted average acquisition cost, excluding DWR.  Will include retained generation, ISO purchases, QF purchases.  Will exclude DWR because these were not purchases made by the utility.

Q.  What is the likelihood that the CPUC will order the utilities to implement the post-January 18 PX credit methodology by re-billing rather than prospective adjustments?

A.  Credits are likely to be calculated on a customer specific basis and applied to future billings for that customer.  

Q. Will the PUC allow PG&E and SCE to modify the historic PX credit calculations (from Oct 2000 through June 2001) based on the FERC refund decision for California energy markets?

A. Yes.  Agree with Sue's comments. Implementation should be same as above question.

Q.  What is the likelihood that the CPUC will order PG&E and SCE to reinstate Enron's outstanding Net Bill amounts if the utilities fail to?  And, will the CPUC order PG&E and SCE to allow this Net Bill amount to be applied against future payments for T&D?

A. Credits will be re-instated but on a customer by customer basis.  In other words, the credit shows up on a customer's bill, not some Enron bill.

Q. What is the likelihood that the CPUC will modify its application of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (a) retroactive to January 4, 2001 or (b) retroactive to March 27, 2001 or (c) prospectively?

A.  Very low.  At best, PUC makes the change retroactive to June 1, which is when the 3 cent surcharge was billed.  If the PUC reversed itself, most likely would be prospective."

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

1999 OFO Settlement Proposal in response to PG&E's August 18 proposal.  We
have carefully reviewed your settlement offer and sought clarification where
needed.  As a result, PG&E is able to accept most of the changes and
provisions contained in that proposal, and is offering back a few
modifications which we think should allow us to reach closure on a
multi-party OFO Settlement Agreement.  We encourage all parties to sign this
settlement.

Our September 24, 1999 response is attached in two forms.  One is a summary
of the items we agree with and those where we have changes, including the
reason for our changes.  The second is a revision-marking of the September
15 proposal to show all the specific changes, including some minor edits.
We have not included the tariff revisions to support this package, but will
provide them once we have a final agreement.  At this point, the changes to
the prior tariff drafts are straight forward.

Also attached is a draft Joint Motion for your review and approval.  Our
suggested approach is to have Settlement Parties sign the motion as the
means of signifying their approval of the Settlement and the need for
expeditious Commission action.

We have scheduled a Settlement Conference next week on Tuesday, September
28, starting at 10:00 a.m. in Room 308, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco.
HOWEVER, the attendance of a couple key parties is problematic, and we may
need to move this settlement meeting to accommodate their schedules so we
can ensure a productive day.  We will advise you no later than Monday
morning of the meeting status and possible next steps.

We appreciate your continued active participation in this settlement process
and look forward to your feedback on our modifications.

Sincerely,



Dan Thomas

Expecting a second baby in March.  Pretty excited. How are Ashly and
Jackson? Good I hope.  What is Jackson now, almost 2?  I bet he's alot of
fun.  I was also writing to ask you if you know anything about the program
Enron has for people with graduate degrees. Chris is furiously looking for
a new job and was just curious about that program that he saw on the Enron
web site.  I was also going to ask you if you knew of any positions there
that might suit Chris' qualifications.  Alot of what he sees on the web is
looking for alot of engineering or Oil & Gas experience.  I told him you
might have an inside track on some things there and that I would check with
you.  I am attaching his resume for you to look at.  If you know of
anything, please give me a call or e-mail me. I would certainly appreciate
it.  Take care and keep in touch.

Subject: CGAS Storage

I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this 
ticket), 268090, and 268093.

Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this 
volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the 
volumes coming out in August.

I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

Let me know if you have any questions.



"
0,"Gentlemen,

Last Feb 22, I sent you an e-mail on an insurance concept to mitigate some of 
the risks of the Delmarva peaking deal.  In essence, the insurance policy 
would trigger off the sale of the asset to a third party, or other 
restructuring designed to recapture and repay moneys owed creditors such as 
Enron.  The basic formula would be (Asset Sale Proceeds - Debt - Moneys Owed 
Enron under both the Financial Buy or Financial Sell contracts = Loss).

I propose that Enron take the first $50/kw of loss and 10% of the balance.

Initial results from numerical analysis suggests I could pay $5 million for 
the policy.

I have attached a simple spreadsheet showing max. possible loss in any year, 
and equity write down each year under the maximum loss scenario.  The equity 
write down is designed to model the likelihood that equity will allow the 
project to go into bankruptcy.

regards,

Don

Jim,
I wanted to confirm that you had received the copy of the NDA that I sent
12/29.

Tomorrow (Wed. 1/5) will be the last day that I am in the office and
available to interact with your legal guys before our meeting on 1/7.  I
will assume, if I have not heard from Enron before 1/6, that the agreement
is acceptable as sent and that we can execute the document when I arrive on
Friday.

0,"As a speaker at EPRM's highly successful Power 2000 event in  Houston, I am 
writing to inform you of our 2001 annual congress and to introduce  myself. I 
will be responsible for the production of all North American EPRM  events 
having moved from our banking conference and training course division in  
July. Just to update you on the whereabouts of the EPRM team, Emma Wolfin is  
developing our technology events for Waters conferences and Joel Hanley will 
be  starting his new role as an EPRM journalist from November 1st.

EPRM 2001 will be held in Houston on the 14th, 15th & 16th  of May and I am 
keen to start the initial research as soon as possible. I intend  to call 
each Power 2000 speaker within the next two weeks. Initially, I would  like 
to provide you with advanced notice of the event and wish to clarify some  
issues.

What current industry developments merit streams or pre/post conference  
seminars at EPRM 2001?

What research are you or your company involved in that would justify  
inclusion in EPRM 2001?

Aside from your own work, what subjects are currently at the  cutting-edge of 
energy risk management?

Who else would you recommend as a potential speaker? (Regulatory bodies,  
academics, practitioners)

Any assistance at this initial stage of research is  appreciated. You can 
email me or call on +44 20 7484 9883. I look forward to  working with you on 
this event.

Senior Conference Producer, EPRM  Conferences"

When we meet later today to discuss the price risk management project, I would like to address the following:
 
1. Should the matrix Masha and I put together of exisiting hedging activity go out to the group (Sue and I had talked about this at one point)?  Attached is the most recent matrix.
 
2. In my absence, who (if anyone) should take over the responsibility of keeping the matrix updated?  If it is someone here, it may be helpful for me to sit down with that person to let them know what I consider to be the best sources of info.
 
3. I have a lot of files organized by state of dockets, etc.  Who should these be passed on to?
 
Thanks,

and still has $1.78 per share in cash.   Readers will recall we computed th=

 the level of cash they had in the bank. Therefore, we believe there is con=
siderably more upside in this group of five stocks.   However, the NASDAQ m=
arket has rebounded dramatically off the September 21st lows, and is probab=
ly a little ahead of itself. Therefore, we would caution members who are lo=

    1.Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead.  Do not walk ahead of me,
for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Just leave me the hell
alone.

    2.The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt and a
leaky tire.

    3.It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal the
neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.

    4.Sex is like air; it's not important unless you aren't getting any.

    5.We are born naked, wet, and hungry. Then things get worse.

    6.No one is listening until you make a mistake.

    7.Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else.

    8.Never test the depth of the water with both feet.

    9.It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a
warning to others.

    10.It is far more impressive when others discover your good qualities
without your help.

    11.If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car
payments.

    12.If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything.

    13.If you lend someone $20, and never see that person again;it was
probably worth it.

    14.Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.  Teach him how to fish,
and he will sit in a  boat and drink beer all day.

    15.If you drink, don't park. Accidents cause people.

    16.Some days you are the bug, some days you are the windshield.

    17.Don't worry, it only seems kinky the first time.

    18.If at first you don't succeed,  skydiving is not for you.

    19.Don't squat with your spurs on.

    20.Good judgment comes from bad experience and a lot of that comes from
bad judgment.

    21.The quickest way to double your money is to hold it in half and put it
back  in your pocket.

    22.Timing has an awful lot to do with the outcome of a raindance.

    23.A closed mouth gathers no foot.

    24.Duct tape is like the force, it has a light side and a dark side and
it holds the universe together.

    25.Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.

    26.There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works.

    27.Never miss a good chance to shut up.

    28.Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your mouth is moving.

    29.Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes.
That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their
shoes.

    30.Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.

    31.Don't be irreplaceable; if you can't be replaced,  you can't be
promoted.

obal's year was a microcosm of the B to B sector on the NASDAQ, which was p=
ounded into oblivion. In the late 90's Wall Street's enormous appetite for =
technology IPOs created an excess supply of technology in this sector, most=
 of which becomes obsolete sooner than companies can get it to customers.  =
 The shrinking economy forced a significant contraction of IT budgets at la=
rge corporations, and the market for XML Global's products vaporized tempor=
arily. XML is a new universal computer language which allows large systems =
to communicate directly with each other. Analysts have long recognized this=
 new language will eventually dominate the B to B space. Most importantly- =
the implementation of this language saves companies money over the long run=
, making its adoption inevitable.   However, after having survived a challe=
nging environment, business seems to be turning the corner at XML Global. T=
his small company has garnered an unusual amount of high profile publicity =
on its products. The December 24th edition of Business Week carried a featu=
re on the company's stolen property tracking software, Xtract. Click Here  =
to read the article. If you have a copy of the magazine, the article can be=
 found on page 75.   The stock dropped all the way from $1 to just under $.=
20, but has since come off the canvas and tripled. Expect the company to co=

 in the late 1980's and early 1990's.   We have always liked this company a=
s they have been consistently profitable and nearly doubled in size every y=
ear for the past three years.   The company embarked on an aggressive expan=
sion plan in the first quarter, gearing up staff to handle a significant in=
crease in business from a large, Houston based hospital chain.   Towards th=
e end of the summer the expansion was derailed by serious flooding in the H=
ouston area, which led to the closing of several hospitals. Shortly thereaf=
ter the September 11th Attack on America also slowed new contract roll outs=
.   New business is back on track, and the company should report a relative=
ly strong fourth quarter. Business should accelerate next year, and the com=
pany should easily exceed the $10 million revenue mark in 2002. Overstaffin=
g for delayed contract roll outs hurt their performance in 2001, but the de=
lays are now in the past.   This company has a unique market niche. There i=
s no other company which specializes in outsourced coding for hospitals. In=
 our opinion, this company is a good candidate for a merger or acquisition =
of some kind in 2002, which could put the stock on the map.   Charts Provid=

HOW WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES

The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are
children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and
fellow heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16, 17).

Lydia is a middle-aged woman who was dealt a bad hand in life
right from the beginning. Memories of ritual and sexual abuse
that she suffered as a young child have haunted her continually
throughout her Christian life. When she came to see me, her
damaged self-image seemed beyond repair. As she told me her
story, Lydia displayed little emotion, but her words reflected
total despair.

When she concluded, I asked, ""Who are you, Lydia? How do you
perceive yourself?""

""I'm evil,"" she answered stoically. ""I'm just no good for
anybody. People tell me I'm evil and all I do is bring trouble.""

""You're not evil,"" I argued. ""How can a child of God be evil? Is
that how you perceive yourself?"" Lydia nodded.

It is never pleasant to see the evil one express his ugly
personality through a victim like Lydia. But realizing that she
is primarily the product of the work of Christ on the cross
instead of the victim of her past, she was able to throw off the
chains of spiritual bondage and begin living according to her
true identity as a child of God.

Nothing is more foundational to your freedom from Satan's bondage
than understanding and affirming what God has done for you in
Christ and who you are as a result. We all live in accordance
with our perceived identity. In fact, we cannot consistently
behave in a way that is inconsistent with how we perceive
ourselves. Your attitudes, actions, responses and reactions to
life's circumstances are often determined by your conscious and
subconscious self-perception. If you see yourself as the helpless
victim of Satan and his schemes, you will live like his victim
and be in bondage to his lies. But if you see yourself as the
dearly loved and accepted child of God that you really are, you
will more likely live like a child of God.

Thank You, Jesus, that You have made me more than a conqueror.
Because of Your love and power, I can live as a victor instead of
a victim today.

0,"I spoke with Chris, and he said this deal is in the system. He didn't know 
the deal number off the top of his head, but he said Constellation is aware 
of it. Would you like me to research further? Or does everything look okay 
from your end now? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Constellation Deal

hey kate,

if this is not taken care of, would you mind following up on it.  
constellation called and is inquiring on a deal that goes with deal 459996 
done through prebon.  there should be another done around dec 1 with no 
broker, buy constellation, jan 01, 100 mw, np 15, index + 3.00.  this deal is 
not in the system as far as i know.  i spoke with chris mallory about this 
situation and i have not heard from him yet.  so that is why i am emailing 
you, i will be out until jan 2, and i just wanted to make sure someone 
follows up on it.  (i think it should be jeff richters deal, but he is out 
also).

my contact at constellation is tom moleatt, 410-468-3620.  i am also copying 
stephanie on this, so she can be your contact here.  hope it is not too 
confusing, but chris knows about this, unless it will already be taken care 
of by the time you return.

thanks!

for the Keystone C/S.

The emissions testing results for the Plains Turbine Station was submitted to 
the TNRCC.

Discharge renewal applications for C/S No. 9 and Monument Turbine C/S were 
submitted to the OCD.

Notification to the New Mexico AQB was given for the power turbine changeout 
at the Atoka No. 2 C/S.

One employee was skill verified for level II environmental 

During the routine weekly sampling of the PG&E system, it was discovered that 
approx. 3 oz of liquid had collected in the new filter separator in the PG&E 
C/S yard.  A request was made to analyze the liquid for not only PCB's but 
also pH to determine if the liquids resulted from the caustic and water 
cleaning of the upstream portion of the pipe leading into the PG&E C/S .  
This is the first occurance of liquids at this location since this new filter 
separator was installed and put inot service."
0,"Gentlemen,

Thankyou for your fine effort. I'll e-mail thru Thurs eve (Sydney time) what
we have done to incorporate it into our material (which wasn't toooo
painful) to see if it is OK with you. A couple of quick questions though.

Vince - your section had a number of footnote numbers, but no actual
footnotes - can you please resend them?

Grant - I agree it would be good to have the final figure. What happens if
you plot the historical data and the simulations on the same graph - but
with different axis?

Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.

In the context of the SFA audit and also your request for info about this 
some time ago (apologies for the delay), I've done some research into our 
current practice and procedure on taping and the position is as follows:

The current policy is to destroy recordings after 6 months.
However, this policy is not being implemented by our Telecoms group at the 
moment which is awaiting confirmation that the 6 month period is appropriate 
(not clear why).  
It appears that no recordings have been destroyed for at least 2 years.
A firm has been contracted to destroy recordings as soon as the go-ahead is 
given.

Obviously we want to be consistent across jurisdictions and I wanted to check 
with you that the retention period in Houston is still 6 months.  Please 
confirm.

Also, John Sherriff is keen for traders to be given guidance on what not to 
say on recorded lines, perhaps with some case studies to provide a salutary 
lesson or two!  Have you guys done anything similar in the US?

I look forward to hearing form you. 

Thanks and regards

Mitch - Whether or not we qualify to even apply for an NPDES permit is 
contingent upon the results of the mercury sampling. If the Mercury 
concentration is greater than 12 ppt, we can not apply for a permit. This is 
a very low threshold and it is likely that we are not going to meet it. The 
sampling was done last week, but the results are not out yet. If the results 
show that we can meet the mercury limit, we still need to assess the cost of 
building a 3-mile pipeline to the white river. We have not yet given 
authorization to do this study. Ross Newlin is taking the lead on this.

If everything goes well, we may be able to submit an application by middle of 
December at the earliest.

Protocol for CEMS approval - CEMS must be installed, certified, and quality 
assured as per the acid rain requirements contained in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 75. The process involves performing a series of 
initial tests, including Relative accuracy test audits (RATAs), linearity 
checks, cycle/response time checks, and calibration drifts.  It also involves 
significant recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

>  a.  Please provide copies of the Westinghouse performance data.
Rick, have we been able to come up with a summary sheet on the performance 
tests?

>  b.  Confirm that all warranties are in name of LLC or transferable
> to LLC.
Stuart, this one is probably more in your bag. I would suggest that we state, 
all bidders should assume that warranties will be placed in the LLC's name 
prior to closing and that all warranties are fully transferable.  (Note that 
currently, the warranties are not in the LLC's name, but are in ENA's name).

>  c.  What is the protocol for CEMS approval.
Gus, can you take a stab at this one?

>  d.  Provide water quality test results.
Don, this should now be in the DD room.

>  e.  Provide all outage reports.
Rick/Brent, do we have all of these?  Any problem with providing them?

>  f.   Provide overhaul budgeting.
Don, not yet developed.  Overhaul budgeting will be completed as any 
scheduled overhaul reaches the near-term horizon.  Our method of budgeting 
for overhauls is to accrue maintenance dollars for every start (approx $1500 
per start).  We continually re-evaluate whether we are starts based or hours 
based.  Currently, we remain starts based maintenance.

>  g.  Provide copy of application for discharge permit.
Application has not yet been submitted.  We have only entered initial 
discussions with the state.  We will submit the application once developed - 
- currently expected by xxxxx date (Gus, please verify this is true).

0,"Attached for your information is a joint petition for modification of the
1998 Revenue Adjustment Proceeding (""RAP"") decision filed today by SCE, PG&E
and SDG&E.  The utilities request that, on an expedited basis, the
Commission limit the scope of the PX Credit audit which WPTF obtained in a
negotiated settlement in the 1998 RAP proceeding to remaining year 2000
calculations and thereafter order that the audit be terminated.  They state
that the audit is both irrelevant and costly and that ""common sense demands""
the Commission reconsider the decision.

They ask that comments in opposition be filed by August 3, reply comments on
August 10 and a Commission decision at its meeting scheduled for August 23.
They also ask the Commission to waive the period provided in Rule 77.7 for
comments and reply comments on a draft decision in order that the decision
become final immediately.

The filing states that there have been dramatic changes in energy markets,
the number of DA customers has declined significantly and that ratepayers
should not have to pay for the audit.  Of course, they don't mention that
the reason for the decline in DA customers is their own failure to pay the
PX Credit.  It is instead attributed to the ""dysfunctional restructuring
scheme and concommitant rise in wholesale energy prices.""  They justify
their request legally by stating that their filing demonstrates that there
are ""significant new facts"" and a ""material change in conditions.""  The
third criteria for reopening or modifying a Commission decision, a basic
misconception of law or fact by the Commission, is not alleged to have
occurred.

They also state that DA penetration will continue to decline because
""Assembly Bills X1-1 and X1-6 have effectively reregulated the market.""

Attached to the filing are declarations from the three ESP members of the
Audit Committee, Bob Anderson of APSES,  Aaron Thomas of AES NewEnergy and
Marilynn Semro of Seattle City Light Department, in support of the
utilities' petition.  I have not reviewed the specific wording changes to
the RAP decision to determine if there are any problems with the proposed
modifications.

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value

Subject: Wellhead Accrual Income

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

0,"Janine:

With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted to 
verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:

(1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)

(2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).  In this 
regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to 
include RMT for internal trades? 

(3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)

There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.  Thanks.
