This was a seasonal thing.  It may pay to make a call to CNG and confirm that

P.S.  Is this pipeline one of mine?

Subject:	New Motion 5/23 and the Milbank DQ opinion

The following was filed today:

1.	Colorado Interstate Gas Company, LTD.

Motion for Entry of an Order (1) Modifying the Automatic Stay to Permit Termination of Contracts or, In the Alternative (2) Compelling Debtors to Assume or Reject Agreements

Debtor: ENA

Deadline: June 10, 2002  
Hearing: June 13, 2002

Summary:
This is yet another motion by a pipeline to terminate its contracts with ENA or compel the assumption or rejection of the contracts.  The arguments are substantially the same as those made by other pipelines.  We were informed by Colorado's counsel (who is the counsel of record on other pipeline capacity motions) that this motion was forthcoming.


And for those who are interested, attached is a copy of the bankruptcy court's bench opinion on the Milbank disqualification motion.  The motion was denied.

0,"The CEO meetings on Thursday went very well, and we had great turnout.  
Attached is a final list of who Ken met with and a list of who we invited.  
The takeaway from both meetings was to draft a letter outlining our 
five-point solution proposal, and the CEOs would be willing to sign it and 
send to the governor and legislators.  Jeff and I drafted the letter and will 
finalize and send it to the CEOs on Monday.  I also think we ought to 
consider placing full-page ads with the letter and enlisting some of the CEOs 
to attend editorial boards.  At this point, it's important to keep Enron out 
of the picture.  We'll route the letter when it's finalized.  kd

		 Subject: DWR Stranded Cost Update

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West 
Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the 
above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their 
analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the 
agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state 
in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their 
nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we 
excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas 
portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  
These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  
Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The 
spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative 
""mark-to-market"" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  
Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

Horns Bound for Holiday Bowl to Face Oregon or Oregon State

The Longhorns accepted a bid Wednesday to play in the Friday, Dec. 29,
Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego, and their opponent will be either
Oregon
or Oregon State. Both Oregon teams shared the Pac 10 title with Washington,

which is playing Purdue in the Rose Bowl.
Oregon State, 10-1, will be the Longhorns' opponent unless the Beavers get
a
berth in one of the BCS bowls, probably the Fiesta. If OSU gets a Fiesta
bid,
then Texas would play Oregon, 9-2.
The Holiday Bowl kickoff will be at 7:30 p.m. Texas time.
Longhorn fans can purchase tickets by calling the UT Ticket Office at
1-800-982-BEVO or local fans can call 471-3333. If anyone wants to buy
tickets in person, the ticket office is located on the first floor in
Bellmont Hall.
Coach Mack Brown said the Longhorns are ""excited about accepting this
invitation"" and he said they are also excited about playing either of the
Oregon teams, because both are ranked in the top 10.
Brown also said the game should help Texas' recruiting efforts in
California
and throughout the Pac 10 area because of its location and he also said it
should help recruiting nationally because it is ""a nationally televised
(ESPN) game that does not compete with any other game that evening.""
Brown said the Longhorns will resume practice on Dec. 13, but he said some
of
the coaches will work with some of  the players next week. Most of the
coaches are on the road recruiting this week and many of them will be out
again next week.
""Recruiting is our top priority right now,"" Brown said.
* * * *
Offensive coordinator Greg Davis said QB Major Applewhite should be close
to
100% by Dec. 29, but neither he nor Brown would indicate whether Applewhite

will get his starting job back or if the nod will go to sophomore Chris
Simms, who was sensational in leading the Longhorns to a 43-17 win over
arch-rival Texas A&M last Friday.
My crystal ball tells me it will be Simms because (a) he had a great game
in
his last outing, and (b) he is completely healthy, while there will be some

questions about Applewhite's sore knee until he actually takes a lick on
it.
I also think the coaches would feel more comfortable with the idea of
Applewhite relieving Simms if Simms had problems than they would be with
Simms handling the pinch-hitting role.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Brown said he will use the bowl practices to take a closer
look at several of the freshman who have been redshirted. He said he
usually
watches them during the season, but said so many of the freshmen were
playing
regularly that the coaches were spending an abnormal amount of time getting

them ready, which  prevented him from seeing as much of the redshirts as he

would have liked. He said FB Will Matthews and TB Sneezy Beltran are two
freshmen he wants to take a good look at to see if they can help the team
next year.
Both Matthews and Beltran have been very impressive on the scout team, and
Brown is looking for a TB to replace senior Hodges Mitchell and he also
wants
to give Matthews a  shot at competing with FB Matt Trissel.
* * * *
FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: The private schools in Texas generally aren't
the
ones who produce top talent for the colleges, but two  freshmen, TE Brock
Edwards of Fort Worth Christian and DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St. Marks,
started several games for Texas this year. There are some top seniors at
the
private schools again this year, headed by DT Thomas Derricks of Dallas
Jesuit. There also is a junior QB at Midland Christian who will be hearing
from some of the top colleges next year. He is Jamie Beeghley, 6-2, 190,
4.55. He led Midland Christian to the state title last week and hit 14 of
19
passes for 195 yards and ran for 112 more yards in the championship game
victory over Fort Worth Christian. . . This year was the year of the
offensive linemen, which was great for the Longhorns because they needed to

sign five or six really good ones and they already have  been assured of
filling that need. Next year probably will be the year of the defensive
linemen, and that is very good for Texas because the Horns need to sign a
bunch of them. I've already seen four or five who would be top recruits
this
year if they were seniors. I mentioned several of them in my last
e-mail/fax
and I'll write more about them in my next newsletter.

My next e-mail/fax will be whenever events warrant.

By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 20, 2001)=20
California electricity prices have shot back up recently, potentially posin=
g=20
an early test of a new federal price-control plan that takes effect today.=
=20
Warm weather has sent wholesale prices doubling this week, partially=20
reversing a dramatic slide that had some state officials believing they'd=
=20
tamed the wildly unpredictable California electricity market.=20
The rebound in prices ""would be expected,"" said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of=
=20
the California Energy Markets newsletter. ""It's 110 degrees in Phoenix, and=
=20
it's 100 degrees (in Sacramento) and points in between.""=20
Prices this week moved back above $100 a megawatt hour, about double what=
=20
they were last week -- although well below the roughly $300 suppliers were=
=20
charging California in mid-May. Prices showed signs of stabilizing Tuesday,=
=20
analysts said.=20
Experts said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new price-mitigatio=
n=20
plan is likely to curb the most severe price spikes. ""This will eliminate t=
he=20
astronomical prices,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University o=
f=20
California Energy Institute.=20
But the plan probably won't bring California a cascade of cheap power,=20
either.=20
Prices likely will bump up constantly against FERC's new price caps, which=
=20
will fluctuate from time to time, and they're not likely to go much below t=
he=20
caps unless there's a significant glut of energy, said Peter Stiffler of th=
e=20
energy consulting firm Economic Insight Inc.=20
""Traders will always trade in at the price ceiling,"" Stiffler said. ""They'r=
e=20
going to offer power at the highest price they can.""=20
The fluctuating FERC caps are tied to the production costs of the=20
least-efficient, most-expensive generating plant operating in California wh=
en=20
supplies are tight and an official ""power alert"" is declared by the state's=
=20
Independent System Operator, which runs most of the power grid. When there=
=20
isn't a power alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the price establishe=
d=20
during the most recent alert.=20
FERC said the system would begin today with a cap of $108.49 a megawatt hou=
r=20
but would rise to $127.64 if a power alert is declared.=20
But the cap can fluctuate significantly. Under the old FERC plan, the price=
=20
cap in May was set at $267 a megawatt hour. The old plan was similar to the=
=20
new system but applied only to California and only kicked in during power=
=20
alerts.=20
With the caps flexible, generators could have incentives to withhold power =
at=20
some plants in order to raise the caps, said Stanford University economist=
=20
Frank Wolak.=20
The FERC plan ""still doesn't solve the problem of withholding,"" said Wolak,=
=20
chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee.=20
Wolak also said he's afraid FERC will let power generators exaggerate their=
=20
costs in order to bump up the caps.=20
""The good news is, they seem to be more serious,"" Wolak said of the=20
oft-criticized commissioners. ""But given how many times we've been taken in=
,=20
I'm wary.""=20
In addition, generators will be allowed to exceed the price caps if they ca=
n=20
justify it to FERC officials. Borenstein said FERC in the past has allowed=
=20
generators to justify just about every price level imaginable, and he's=20
suspicious that the commission will let generators do the same in order to=
=20
evade the new price controls.=20
State officials, while cautiously optimistic about the plan, were upset tha=
t=20
FERC will allow a 10 percent price premium on electricity because of the ri=
sk=20
of selling to the California market.=20
""We recognize that the risk of nonpayment in California continues to be=20
greater"" than in other states, the commission said in its written opinion,=
=20
released late Tuesday.=20
Gov. Gray Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the premium ludicrous=20
because the state Department of Water Resources has been buying electricity=
=20
ever since the state's troubled utilities exhausted their credit in=20
mid-January.=20
""The state is as creditworthy a buyer as you can get,"" Maviglio said.=20
Experts said the plan also won't correct the state's energy imbalance.=20
""None of this is going to have much effect on blackouts,"" Borenstein said.=
=20
""This is solving part of the problem; I'm worried people will think=20
everything has been solved.=20
""The emphasis now has to be on getting California to conserve,"" he added.=
=20
A spokesman for power generators, Gary Ackerman, said the price controls=20
could worsen shortages this summer and will discourage generating firms fro=
m=20
investing in the new power plants the West desperately needs.=20
Builders ""are going to sit on the fence and think about this,"" said Ackerma=
n,=20
head of the Western Power Trading Forum.=20
Acting in the face of mounting political pressure and unrelenting criticism=
=20
from California, FERC voted Monday to impose round-the-clock price controls=

The FERC plan replaces a three-week-old plan that applied only to Californi=

and took effect only when power reserves fell to below 7 percent of demand=

State to borrow up to $5 billion to buy energy=20
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 20, 2001)=20
State Treasurer Phil Angelides announced Tuesday that he will borrow up to =
$5=20
billion to pay for future power purchases, a move he said was necessary to=
=20
avoid a continued drain on California's budget and cuts in other state=20
programs.=20
Since mid-January, energy purchased by the state Department of Water=20
Resources on the spot market and under long-term contracts has come out of=
=20
the state's general fund, the source of most state spending.=20
Once the loan becomes final by the end of next week, however, energy will b=
e=20
purchased with the proceeds.=20
Made possible by an emergency order from the governor, the loan ultimately=
=20
will be paid off by customers of the state's investor-owned utilities throu=
gh=20
their electricity rates.=20
""In essence, it stops the general fund bleeding,"" Angelides said.=20
The state has so far committed $8.2 billion from the general fund to=20
electricity purchases. Of that amount, Angelides said the Department of Wat=
er=20
Resources has actually spent about $6.1 billion through June 12 on power=20
purchases, and has received about $900 million back from customers'=20
electricity rates.=20
Officials expect the loan to finance power purchases through September, whe=
n=20
they plan to issue up to $13.4 billion in revenue bonds.=20
The bonds will reimburse the general fund and and pay off the loan.=20
""This gives the state some more running room, some more cushion in case=20
anything goes awry with the bond sale to make sure ... the state does not r=
un=20
out of general fund money, jeopardizing education programs, law enforcement=
=20
programs, children's and health services,"" the Democratic treasurer said.=
=20
Angelides said he has obtained firm commitments for $3.5 billion from JP=20
Morgan and Lehman Brothers at a blended interest rate of about 4.5 percent.=
=20
If the long-term bonds are not issued by Oct. 31, the interest rate would=
=20
climb to about 7 percent.=20
Lawmakers initially had hoped to close the short-term loan in May and float=
=20
the long-term bonds shortly thereafter. However, Republicans in the state=
=20
Legislature balked at the plan, forcing the delay of the bond sale until=20
mid-August.=20
Rather than wait, Gov. Gray Davis invoked his emergency powers to allow for=
=20
the loan and circumvent the delay.=20
Assembly Republicans don't mind that the governor used his emergency powers=
=20
to expedite the loan, said James Fisfis, a spokesman for the caucus. Instea=
d,=20
he said, they're concerned the loan could backfire and hurt Californians.=
=20
""If the larger bond offering falls through, the penalties and added interes=
t=20
could add up on ratepayers' bills,"" he said.=20
But Angelides argued that the loan would benefit ratepayers on several=20
fronts: Power generators can no longer argue the state should pay a ""credit=
=20
premium"" on electricity, he said, and for the most part will not be able to=
=20
walk away from long-term energy contracts that have provisions requiring th=
e=20
Department of Water Resources to obtain external financing by July 1.=20
Outside the Legislature, the announcement drew praise from financial analys=
ts=20
who had criticized the state for buying power with taxpayer money.=20
In late April, for instance, Standard & Poor cited fears over the state's=
=20
mounting power costs when it downgraded California's credit rating on state=
=20
bonds.=20
But S&P managing director Steven Zimmermann called the governor's executive=
=20
order a step in the right direction.=20
""We're very happy,"" Zimmermann said. ""We were very anxious for the state to=
=20
take the general fund out of the energy purchasing position it's been in.""=

Dan Walters: Once burned, lawmakers are very wary of Davis-Edison agreement


(Published June 20, 2001)=20
The Capitol's politicians rarely attempt to resolve big, complicated policy=
=20
issues, preferring to occupy their time with relatively trivial matters --=
=20
which also tend to be the priorities of well-heeled and generous interest=
=20
groups.=20
And when they even acknowledge a need to address something big, they'll oft=
en=20
just nibble at the edges rather than confront the underlying conflicts=20
squarely. That's been the pattern on water, transportation, population grow=
th=20
and public education, to name but a few of many examples.=20
The Capitol completed just one comprehensive, or seemingly comprehensive, b=
it=20
of policymaking during the last quarter-century. But the issue on that=20
occasion was electric utility deregulation, which has exploded into an ener=
gy=20
crisis of monumental proportions. And that experience is having a paralyzin=
g=20
effect on the Capitol's denizens.=20
Some Capitol old-timers call it ""1890 disease,"" named after the number of t=
he=20
1996 bill that created California's fatally flawed system of pricing electr=
ic=20
power. The legislation was written largely by lobbyists for affected intere=
st=20
groups and then presented to the full Legislature for take-it-or-leave-it=
=20
approval. The measure was passed without a single dissenting vote, even=20
though only a few lawmakers even began to understand its ramifications.=20
It was a huge failure of the legislative process, virtually a dereliction o=
f=20
duty, and those who participated have been doing some fancy explaining. But=
=20
given the history, both veteran legislators and those who came to the Capit=
ol=20
after 1996 are very leery about putting their names on additional pieces of=
=20
energy policy that could backfire if the real-world outcome is markedly=20
different from the purported effects.=20
One example is the $43 billion in long-term energy supply contracts=20
negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis' administration to end the state's dependence=
=20
on volatile spot market prices. When the long-term contracting program was=
=20
authorized by the Legislature early this year, it was on the assurances of=
=20
the administration that it could obtain large quantities of power at cheap=
=20
prices. But by the time that the contracts were made final, months later, t=
he=20
average price was 25 percent higher than what was stated earlier, while the=
=20
spot market had fallen dramatically. Now the long-term contracts that seeme=
d=20
like such a good idea in January and February could become financial=20
albatrosses.=20
An even more telling example is the deal Davis made with Southern Californi=
a=20
Edison to keep the utility from joining Pacific Gas and Electric in=20
bankruptcy. The utilities accumulated at least $13 billion in debts in six=
=20
months, buying power at prices much higher than they were allowed to=20
recapture from their customers. Consumer groups are denouncing the Edison=
=20
deal as a corporate bailout that would impose multibillion-dollar burdens o=
n=20
customers while imposing virtually no financial onus on Edison or its=20
creditors. And the deal's critics are pouncing on legislators' reluctance t=
o=20
do something that might haunt them later -- especially in 2002, a critical=
=20
election year.=20
""Five years ago, lawmakers and the utilities foolishly foisted this=20
deregulation scheme onto California consumers, and now the governor and=20
Edison expect the ratepayers to pay billions more to save the utilities fro=
m=20
their own mismanagement and bad policy decisions,"" consumer gadfly Harvey=

Rosenfield said Tuesday as legislative hearings opened on the Edison deal.=

Harry Snyder of Consumers Union echoed Rosenfield's pledge to hold=20
legislators accountable. ""It looks a lot like 1890,"" Snyder said. ""It's too=

Davis, Regulators Face Off at Hearing

From Reuters=20

?????WASHINGTON -- California Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat, today blamed=
 a=20
Republican-led energy regulatory agency for not doing enough to help his=20
energy-starved state and demanded refunds of $6.7 billion for alleged=20
price-gouging by power generators.
?????Davis, whose political future has been linked to his state's electrici=
ty=20
woes, was testifying at a Senate hearing with members of the Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission.
?????The hearing marked the first time that Davis met face to face with all=
=20
five FERC commissioners.
?????FERC regulates interstate electricity markets and has jurisdiction to=
=20
order refunds by power generators found to have overcharged utilities.
?????Earlier this week the agency, led by a Republican majority, rejected=
=20
Davis' pleas for strict caps on prices that soared above $400 per megawatt=

hour last month.
?????Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee=
,=20
heads the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that quizzed the FERC=20
commissioners and Davis on efforts to stabilize the chaotic Western=20
electricity market.
?????Davis accused FERC of failing to act aggressively against alleged=20
price-gouging by out-of-state generators.
?????""To date, not a single penny in refunds has been returned to=20
Californians,"" Davis said. ""It is unconscionable for the generators to prof=
it=20
from their egregious overcharges. FERC must move quickly to enforce the law=
=20
and order the energy companies to give back the money.""
?????Davis said the state is owed refunds of at least $6.7 billion.=20
California's grid operator has estimated that from May 2000 to May 2001,=20
power generators charged the state nearly $9 billion more than a competitiv=
e=20
market would warrant, he said.
?????California, the nation's most populous state, has been hit with a seri=
es=20
of rolling blackouts, the bankruptcy of its largest utility, and an economi=
c=20
slowdown since the power crisis began last year.
?????The state is expected to convene a criminal grand jury to investigate=
=20
whether some power generators withheld supplies, shut down plants or=20
exploited the bidding process to drive up prices. Out-of-state generators=
=20
deny any illegal activity, saying the high prices simply reflect supply=20
shortages.
?????Today also marks the day that FERC's newly expanded ""price mitigation""=
=20
program goes into effect in all 11 Western states with a wholesale price=20
limit of $107.9 per megawatt hour linked to a market formula. The plan had=
=20
previously applied only to California during emergency power outages.
?????Since FERC's action earlier this week, Senate Democrats dropped a=20
legislative effort to strictly cap electricity prices in the West. However,=
=20
California Democrats in the House were still trying to force a full vote on=
 a=20
package of energy amendments, including a price cap.
?????The Bush administration and many Republicans oppose price caps,=20
contending they would discourage more power production.
?????Separately, today the U.S. Energy Department issued a study that=20
supported the White House's view that strict price caps would hurt, not hel=
p,=20
California.
?????The study found California faces about 113 hours of rolling blackouts=

this summer, a level that would double if wholesale prices were capped at=

$150 per megawatt because some 3,600 megawatts of generating capacity would=

shut down. An alternative approach of setting a price cap based on producti=
on=20
costs plus $25 per megawatt would delay or close about 1,300 megawatts of=
=20
capacity scheduled to be built in the state, according to the study.
?????However, lawmakers from both political parties have scrambled for some=
=20
kind of solution to address the shortages in California well before the=20
congressional elections next year.
?????The FERC plan expands an existing ""price mitigation"" program in=20
California to 10 other Western states. The plan, which runs through Septemb=

Subject: GE 7FA

Dave,

A DASH will be circulating later today for approximately $16MM for $10MM of 
progress payments on a 7FA and certain development costs for our Longview 
Project.  Chip Schneider and I have agreed that this approach allows us to 
get to NTP on the project (up until August 20), or determine a higher-valued 
use for the turbine in the event the development does not get finalized for 
some reason.  Given the strength of the PNW market, this project is in the 
money using Enron mid curves for gas and power.  

Mike Miller has appropriately backed away - my team is engaged directly with 
GE on the contract negotiation and a term sheet is expected to be signed 
tomorrow.
I am highly confident that this will result in a 2001 gain of $15MM-$20MM.   

I was planning to talk with Louise about this at our call this morning.  Are 
you or she the appropriate signor for EA?  I will also contact Mark Frevert 
early this afternoon to discuss.   

Regards,

Chris

Subject: Teco's Indian Spring Plant

A meeting was held on November 1, 2000 at 3 pm in EB3270 to resolve Exxon's 
residue volume issue at Teco's Indian Spring Plant.   Exxon's issue is that 
the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for 
transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to 
PGE.   

Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved:

 1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line 
attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production.
 2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis 
elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects 
to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL.
 3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco 
can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes. 
 4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate 
the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue 
to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must 
pay to Teco an additional $500 per month.

Solution:
 1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884 
that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line.
 2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL 
Meter #986884. 
 3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset 
volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes.
 4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack 
Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d.

If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please 
let me know at X-36650.

Thanks, Clem

Subject: Argentina Retail Unbundling

I've been thinking about Michael Guerreiro's desire to push retail 
unbundling, particularly for gas, in Argentina.  As we know, Michael had 
experience in the Atlanta area on retail unbundling prior to joining Enron; 
therefore, he knows what he is after and asserts (correctly) that the 
attainment of retail unbndling is critical for his success as new head of the 
Argentina trading office -- without it, Enron cannot be successful.   It is 
important for us to accommodate Michael's sense of urgency; however, to 
blindly act, make filings and lobby without having thought through the issues 
would not be in Enron's best interest.  We have experience in regulatory in 
Argentina and know that action without forethought is not a wise course of 
action.

As an initial thought, I would suggest that the US retail unbundling 
experience is not 100% transferrable to Argentina and that Enron should 
carefully construct a phased approach that is adapted to the Argentina 
political and regulatory realities.  To do this, I suggest the following:

Schedule 1-2 days in January in Houston for a strategy session.  I suggest 
Houston over Buenos Aires, only because of the inclusion of so many of the 
people who are not Southern Cone related.  We could try for Southern Cone if 
that is your preference, but I am concerned about the likelihood of getting 
all the below-named individuals to travel internationally.

 A. The first day would be the construction of the regulatory overview of 
retail unbundling, the final product being a matrix of what the process 
entails and what the major issues are and generally how these issues are 
being managed in the United States.  I would involve the following people in 
this session:

  Mike Smith
  Guillermo Canovas
  Jose Bestard
  Jane Wilson
  Robert Neustaedter
  Harry Kingerski
  Pat Keene
  Michael Guerreiro?
  Roberto Pensotti?

Pat Keene and Robert Neustaedter to take the lead on constructing a 
presentation.  Harry is a Sr. Director for Steve Kean in detailed rates and 
tariffs issues.  I hired him as my director at EES.  He is a regulatory whiz, 
although his emphasis is power.  I also hired Pat Keene who is a regulatory 
gas distribution guru from New Mexico.  He now works for Harry in Steve 
Kean's group.  [Jose, to the end of the construction of the working group, 
perhaps Pat Keene could be permanent with Harry brought in on a consultative 
basis periodically.]

 B. Day two would be a sharing of experience in Georgia (Atlanta), New York, 
and the UK, followed by the construction of actual Argentine strategy with a 
timeline.  The point here would be to learn how the facts of the specific 
fact situation in Georgia, New York, UK and FERC affected the outcomes of the 
general retail unbundling issues.  This will make it easier to anticipate 
what will happen in Argentina.  The guests would be:

  Kathleen Magruder -- Atlanta
  Lisa Polk -- EES, worked on the details in Atlanta
  Steve Montovano -- Brooklyn Union
  Joe Hartsoe -- Washington FERC VP 
  Someone (Philip Davies or Doug Wood -- cannot remember which is gas?) from 
Mark Schroeder's group.
  The attendees on Day One

This is a tall order for one day; perhaps we could prepare well in advance on 
Day One to cut time and start Day Two in the afternoon of Day One?  

[Jose, the UK person should be on the working group.  Perhaps you should 
think about two working groups, one  Argentina, one Brazil, with alternates 
for gas and electric?]

My suggestion is that Houston Regulatory would pull together this strategy 
session for Argentina and assist with drafting the actual initial filings or 
comments on an input basis.  The Southern Cone group would then take over to 
get it done, you consulting the working group on an ongoing basis as things 
develop.  

I'm going to India for a week Monday.  However, I download on a regular 
basis; but, because of time differences, my response will be a day later than 
you think it should be, assuming I have no trouble with e:mail.

Subject:	HOME DEPOT, ETC --- TEXAS CUSTOMERS GREATER THAN 1 MW

There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.

To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --

1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).

2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms =

TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  
Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.

3.	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.

4.	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.

5.	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.

6.	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.  This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year.

I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice."

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego 
Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, 
overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity 
service. 
On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy 
Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), 
AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class 
action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. 
The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A 
news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday 
morning in San Diego.
Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is 
active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate 
contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back 
into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold 
in the state. 
An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable 
to comment. 
The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply 
last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used 
real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. 
The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion 
for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason

0,"John,

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Alexandra Jones"

Can you change the Huber transaction agreement to reflect the pricing provisions we have laid out in the LOI.  The only other thing I saw in the Capacity release agreement was in 2.6.  If they owe us for any refunds prior to the release date, then we should owe them for any charges in the future for any past periods.

Thanks

We are trying to send out a draft version of these on Monday afternoon.

I believe that your skillset would be a positive addition to the West Gas origination group. We can provide for you a new learning experience by becoming a key component of the team.

You will learn a tremendous amount about the Natural gas business with exposure stemming from the wellhead to the burner tip. Some areas include, commodity price risk structures, risk management initiatives, financial and physical markets, structured products and transportation related initiatives.  

Please use this note as a formal offer of employment. I would like you to start as soon as you can.. ( next 2 weeks) and will leave this for you to think about until the end of day on Monday.

We need to provide wording to the auditors regarding the following:
1.	Notification wrt ""Trades in Error"" - Article 6.2

0,"I think Jeff like myself has been out of the office so I am responding from 
the US tax side. Jeff please correct the following as appropriate.

When the US tax group reviewed the original matrix they identified 
counterparties as being unable to trade US financials where those parties 1) 
were not incorporated in the US, and 2) there was no US withholding tax 
documentation on file. Where on the matrix it was not clear where an entity 
was incorporated it was assumed for this purpose NOT to have been 
incorporated in the US.

Thus if the review establishes that in fact some of these entities are 
incorporated in the US, the prohibition on these entities trading US 
financials can be lifted.

Jeff was in the process of reviewing the matrix.

Subject: Re: Country/State of Incorporation  

For U.S. based counterparties, State of Incorporation is fairly readily 
available from Dun & Bradstreet - if they are in fact incorporated entities.
 We have only recently requested a full extract of this information from D&B 
for our counterparties (because this is also required for SAP).
 Because of difficulties in matching our records to D&B - their names are NOT 
always the exact legal name - we have only been able to obtain
 roughly 7365 out of the more than 11,400 records we have (65%).  Of the 7365 
records matched, not all have State of Incorporation either because 
 1) They are not U.S. parties or 2) They are not incorporated entities or 3) 
D&B is missing the information (990).

 We recently obtained a list of state of incorporation for companies from 
Legal which is the source we were going to use to populate this information 
for the  ones we were missing.  We hired temps to do this, but were then 
requested to stop this activity by Frank Davis.

 For Foreign entities, the country of incorporation has been difficult to 
find as it is not readily available from D&B.  Any knowledge or suggestions 
would be appreciated.

We are changing our procedures to request this information when we call the 
counterparty to collect information for setup.

In reviewing the counterparty matrix of 9/8, we can assist with providing 
some of the state of incorporations for parties in Sections 2,3, and 4.  I 
have asked IT to extract this information from GCP for you.  Country of 
Incorporation for non-U.S. does not yet exist in GCP - this is currently 
under development with a target production date of mid-October therefore, 
this cannot be provided.  I think however, that the London Credit system has 
Country of Registration (same as Incorporation) that could possibly help.

As soon as the values we have for State of Incorporation are populated in the 
counterparty matrix, I will forward to you.

Subject: Country/State of Incorporation

The objective of EnronOnline is to trade with as many people as possible in 
as many product types as possible.  

Both the legal and tax reviews that I have seen thus far have included 
non-trade status customers that I understand may or may not be eligible to 
trade if we had the country/state of incorporation.  Apparently our records 
are not very robust relative to this piece of information.  

If possible I would like to get a better understanding of all the issue 
surrounding country of incorporation so that we can determine the best course 
of action for obtaining this information if we determine that it is 
essential.  In addition to ensure that we collect this information each time 
we add a new counterparty.

Short of having this information it is my understanding that US tax has 
completed its review of the counterparty matrix and 

Questions:

Is anyone aware of an easy way of obtaining country/state of incorporation?

If we had country/state of incorporation how many counterparties would be 
affected?  (That is if we had country/state of incorporation it might allow 
us to take a counterparty from non-trade status to trade status.)

Can we identify the counterparty names (on the customer matrix which was 
e-mailed on 08/09/99 copy attached) which might be affected by having 
country/state of incorporation?

Is this the only remaining issue impacting the tax review of the counterparty 
matrix dated 08/09/99.  If so are Jeff and Janine ready to sign off on the 
matrix? Can I get a copy of your completed matrix for upload?

Subject: Pueblo

Here's a weird one.  Could we structure the Pueblo pipeline project with the 
following characteristics: 
1.  The lateral from TW's mainline to Albeq. is wholly TW owned (i.e., no 
joint venture with Langley);
2.  The lateral  is 100% debt financed (i.e., it is expected to cost about 
$20 million, which TW would borrow in a project financing, secured by the 
revenue stream under the firm contract for service on the new lateral);
3.  TW files for a 7(c) certificate, seeking an incremental rate for service 
on the new lateral;  Any service on the TW mainline will be subject to TW's 
existing rates;
4.  TW designs the max. incremental rate based on normal cap. structure, 
deprec., O&M, allocations, etc.
5.  TW has one contract for 40,000/day, for 10 years for service on the 
lateral;
6.   The rate for that one customer is a negotiated rate that is based on an 
alternative ratemaking study under which the customer pays enough $$ to cover 
debt service on the project financing, incremental deprec., O&M, A&G, etc.  
No allocated costs or any other costs related to TW's preexisting facilities 
are included in the negotiated rate.  
7.  TW is entirely at risk for cost recovery, but the one contract covers all 
actual costs, except return and taxes on the new line. Basically, the one 
contract locks in a floor of break even cash flow.  If TW fails to lock up 
any additional customers there will never be any ""taxable income"" for the 
line since debt servicing costs and other expenses completely eat up the 
revenue under the one big contract.  Therefore, there will never be any 
return or taxes related to the new line, unless TW locks up additional 
contracts.  
8.  Any additional contracts TW locks up will generate TW's upside for the 
project. 

The question is can we do this?  Will FERC let us build it?  Will FERC let us 
oversize the pipeline significantly larger than the 40,000/day that the one 
big firm customer needs?   I'm sure I've left out important facts, so I'll 
try to grab you tomorrow to discuss.  

The overall objective is to create the ""leanest"" possible initial cost 
structure for the pipeline, and therefore for the Langley power plant, 
consistent with TW being able to get the new pipeline built.  I.e., lets get 
the pipe built and help the power plant get to a cheap enough elec. rate that 
they can get their big contract with the govt.  and economically sell surplus 
off-peak power onto the grid.  Even if the new incremental rate for service 
on the lateral is a break even rate, TW's upside comes from incremental 
throughput from the Permian to the new lateral, at a rate of $___/MMBtu, and 
from any additional bypass load we can pick up from PNM (it looks like TW's 
rates off of the new line will beat PNM's industrial rates).   

I appreciate your input on this.  DF

""Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron,"" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO. ""He has the trust and confidence of our investors and financial institutions."" 
Andrew Fastow, previously Enron's CFO, will be on a leave of absence from the company. ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Lay said.

Upon returning to the United States, McMahon was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works, where he had responsibility for Enron's e-commerce activities. 
McMahon has a bachelor's degree in business from the University of Richmond in Virginia. He is a Certified Public Accountant, SFA registered and is a member of the American Institute of Public Accountants and Association of Corporate Treasurers.

0,"There is an opportunity to update our existing testimony in the hydro
proceeding based upon current market information.  As PG&E is saying $2.8
billion reflects current market prices, I think we should consider filing
something that would indicate that the value of the assets is greater than
what we had previously submitted $3.4 billion.

We have to consider the FERC order and the likelihood that prices that were
experienced this summer is not likely to re-occur, to the same extent, next
summer.

I will submit an RCR, but want to make sure we discuss it first and give
MRW adequate time to do their analysis, should we decide to file.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks."

ideas into a couple of diagrams and e-Strategy statement.  I have worked

0,"We all knew about this concept--its Danny's ""Newco"" idea.  The only thing 
that is new is they finally decided on a name and got the paperwork for the 
new corporate entity out of the Corporate Secretary's office.  I knew about 
the name a couple weeks ago.  As far as I know, no one has signed off on any 
particular transaction or on a procedure to follow when ""Mavrix"" starts 
transacting business.  We all better understand at that point that this may 
be a ""lose lose"" deal--if Mavrix makes a ton of money, everyone will come 
after it (as soon as they find out) and claim we arre playing games with 
confidential information if Mavrix is trading capacity on the Enron pipes.  
If Mavrix loses money, tough cookie--there's no way to plow the losses back 
into some regulated entity.  It is probably now time to have a prayer meeting 
with Danny, Steve, and probably Stan, just to make sure everyone knows what 
we all think about the risks before they charge off and start doing deals.

Subject: Re: Mavrix  

I thought the officers had discussed this with Danny quite some time ago, as 
the organization of the company was set in motion in early Dec.

Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp. has been organized as a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of ETS for the purpose of transportation capacity management.  The 
officers are the same as the slate of officers of Transwestern.   The company 
will neither buy or sell gas nor use transportation capacity.  However, it 
does plan to enter into natural gas transportation contracts (and resell the 
capacity thru capacity release).  That is why the creditworthiness question 
has come up.
I really don't have any information so send you, unless you want to see the 
organizational documents.  Steve Harris can answer any business-related 
questions you have.  Or, I'll be happy to try to answer any other questions.

Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp., which is a subsidiary of ETS, needs to 
satisfy TW's creditworthiness requirements in order to enter into a 
transportation agreement with TW.  Paul Cherry has suggested that Northern 
Natural Gas issue a guarantee.  Please let me know whether you think this 
would be acceptable.  If Mavrix wanted to hold NNG capacity, TW could issue 
the guarantee.

I know you are quite busy but I wonder if you could get your lead trader to look the following forecast for NEEPOOL. This may result in you getting the lead for a large block of the power so be conservative but have enough in there so it is a win win if you know what I mean.
 
Have him fill in what he can. The client will be looking long 10 year, with maybe a series of 2 and 5 year deals. Should be putting out around 500 to 700 Mwe.
 
Do not disclose the plant eh ?

0,"Why did we change the name for the Board of Municipal Utilities of Sikeston, 
Mo.?  That is the way the counterparty's financial statement reads as well as 
how the name is set up on their website?  I also spoke to their lawyer and he

confirms from the purchase date on your securities so we can see when
the securities were purchased?  We need to know the date because of the
currency conversion.  Dale Onrait in Canada said you purchased the
securities from another branch so he does not have the records.  This is
for your benefit in determining your position if you sell the
securities.

Also, please contact Dale to sell your Canadian securities and have them
convert the proceeds to US$.  Tell them to send the money to us for your

Subject: CPN: Announces New Texas Power Sales Contracts;
EarningsVisibili ty Enhanced


Good Afternoon:

Attached, please find our recent FC note on Calpine.

 <<cpn071801.pdf>> 
Summary
1) We reiterate our Strong Buy rating on Calpine.  Over the last 2 days, the
company has announced a number of significant power sales agreements
associated with its Texas capacity.
2) On July 17, CPN announced that it had entered into 2 agreements with
Reliant Energy services to provide 1,000 MW of power over a 5 year period.
On July 18, CPN announced an agreement with Shell Oil to provide up to 3,000
MW of power, also over a 5 year period.  All the contracts commence on
January 1, 2002, which coincides with the beginning of retail competition in
Texas.
3) Other details relating to pricing and contract structure were not
disclosed.
4) In Texas, CPN currently owns 2,337 MW capacity in operation, 3,786 MW
under construction and 1,007 MW under development.
5) Importantly, as a result of these announcements and other recent
agreements, Calpine's Texas capacity is now 85% sold forward for the next 2
years.  Overall, this hedged position gives us additional comfort in CPN's
ability to meet or exceed our 2001-2003 EPS estimates of $1.94, $2.35 and
$3.08, respectively.
6) Some investors have expressed concern about Calpine's exposure to
potential overbuilding in the Texas market.  CPN's recent contract
announcements should reassure investors that the company is actively taking
steps to manage and minimize its market price risk in this region.

Marketing
-- Desert Crossing Storage (near Kingman, AZ).  Their strategic advantage seems to be accessing cheaper Rockies gas via Kern River and putting it into storage for later delivery to California markets.  One partner, SRP, is banking on getting a firm backhaul on El Paso to serve their Phoenix requirements.  Unless someone significantly expands the California infrastructure and interstate delivery points, the only beneficiary of this project will be Sempra with its North Baja power plant and this is not enough to justify the storage project.

--  Pataya Storage is another project soon to be announced by partners SouthWest Gas and Aquila Energy.  They plan to develop 12 Bcf of salt dome storage (in 2 phases) in the same formation as Desert Crossing.  Their plan is to tie into El Paso and TW; we have been in contact and await their response to our suggestion of incorporating a Sun Devil pipeline option.

--  Our response to APS on the transport option if they reimburse TW for EIS costs is expected to go out 1/25.  We are drafting a similar offer to Panda Energy.

--  Panda Energy:  The current economic conditions have struck Panda-- they have initiated a restructuring and severed some of the headquarters staff including fuel supply representatives we were negotiating with for Sun Devil.  The project now reverts back to the department VP whom we have contacted to further our negotiations. 

Engineering -  still waiting on the revised project cost estimate based on the reduced compressor and looping costs.  The goal is $100 million in reductions.  

FERC and El Paso Full Requirements Contracts - The discussion of the Strawman settlement proposal submitted by SRP to FERC did not make it on FERC's January agenda.  At our meeting this week, APS did not put much faith in the Strawman making much forward progress.  "

Here's the bill of sale we didn't use on the last deal.  I don't know how 
much good it will do you, but at least it gives you some tax language.  As I 
mentioned, the last deal was supposed to be a ""wire me money, I'll sell you

I'd like to see the installment sale form once it gets fixed up, if possible.

Lawmakers seek to oust three PSC members

Rep. Dennis Bonner (D., District 51) and Sen. Ronnie DePasco (D.,
District 11) are trying to oust three members of the Public Service
Commission who refused to hold a public hearing before the PSC approved
a Missouri Gas Energy application to raise its rates by 44%.  Bonner
filed a resolution in the House yesterday afternoon seeking the removal
of the commissioners, and DePasco plans to file an identical resolution
in the Senate today, Bonner told TR.

The 44% rate hike was ""ridiculous,"" Bonner told TR.  ""People in my
district can't afford to pay that.""  Bonner said, however, that he
""would have been happy if [the commissioners] would have held a
hearing.""  Bonner said he and DePasco had warned the PSC in advance that
they would try to expel any commissioners who approved the rate hike
request without holding a public hearing first.

The three commissioners who voted in favor of the rate increase were
Chairwoman Sheila Lumpe and Commissioners Connie Murray and M. Dianne
Drainer.  Bonner and DePasco aren't trying to remove commissioners
Kelvin Simmons and Robert Schemenauer, who voted against the rate
increase.

FUTURE OF REGULATION
LOUISIANA
PSC elects new leadership

The Public Service Commission has elected Commissioner James M. Field
(R., District 2) as its new chairman, a commission staff member told
TR.  Commissioner Jack A. (Jay) Blossman Jr. (R., District 1) was
elected vice chairman.

Field joined the PSC Dec. 2, 1996, and his term ends Dec. 31, 2006.
Blossman became a commission member Jan. 1, 1997, and his term expires
Dec. 31, 2002.

MONTANA
House unanimously approves Uniform Electronic Transactions Act

The House has approved overwhelmingly a Uniform Electronic Transaction
Act to prohibit anyone from denying legal effect or enforceability to a
record or signature solely because it's in electronic form.  (1/19/01
a.m.)  Secretary of State Mike Cooney (D.) requested HB 234, which was
sponsored officially by Rep. Bob Lawson (R., District 80).

Each government agency would be able to determine whether and to what
extent it would send and accept electronic records and electronic
signatures.  Government agencies, however, wouldn't be limited to any
specific types of technologies.

HB 234 also states that electronic signatures would be valid only if all
parties agreed to conduct a transaction electronically.  If a party
agreed to conduct one transaction by electronic means, the party could
refuse to conduct other transactions electronically.  This right to opt
out of electronic transactions couldn't be waived.

HB 234 awaits consideration by the Senate Business and Labor Committee.

ALTERNATIVE REGULATION
MONTANA
Lawmakers to examine price cap regulation

State lawmakers will be considering a bill to allow telecom carriers to
opt out of rate-of-return regulation if they accept price cap
regulation.  LC 655, which awaits introduction, states that a local
exchange carrier's (LEC's) election to accept price cap regulation would
be irrevocable.  Qwest Corp. proposed the bill's language, the
legislative staff told TR.  Sen. Fred Thomas (R., District 31) requested
the measure.

LB 655 would set a LEC's price caps at the permanent rates last
authorized by the Public Service Commission for the company before it
elected to come under the new regulatory structure.  The price floors
would be set at total-service long-run incremental cost.

The new prices set under the price cap regulation would be indefinite;
no specific time reference is included in the draft bill.  The PSC
wouldn't be able to change the price caps unless changes were needed to
reflect a new tax or fee.  The prices also could change to allow a LEC
to recover the additional cost of providing a new telecom service or the
expense of a new or expanded program, such as an extended area service
region.

Additionally, the prices could change if the LEC filed an application
with the PSC and justified a change in a price cap.  The commission
would have 60 days to act on the application.

If a complaint were filed by a consumer or consumer counsel regarding
the company's prices and the PSC found the company had violated the
provisions of this measure, the commission would have the authority to
order the LEC to comply with the measure.  The draft bill is available
at http://data.opi.state.mt.us/bills/2001/lchtml/LC0655.htm.

IOWA
Bill aims to provide equal treatment for cable TV companies

Sen. Mary Lundby (R., District 26) has introduced SF 47 to require a
city granting more than one cable TV franchise to make the terms and
conditions of the additional franchise no more favorable and no less
burdensome than those of the existing franchise agreement.

Terms and conditions would include the territorial extent of the
franchise; system design; technical performance standards; construction
schedule; performance bonds; standards for construction and installation
of cable TV facilities; service to subscribers; public, government, and
educational access channels and programming; liability and
indemnification; and franchise fees.

If the terms or conditions of any additional franchise were more
favorable or less burdensome than the terms or conditions of any
existing cable TV franchise, the more favorable or less burdensome terms
or conditions also would apply for any existing cable TV franchise.

SF 47 has been referred to the Senate Commerce Committee.

ILLINOIS
ICC seeks extension of 10-digit dialing in Chicago area

The state Commerce Commission yesterday asked the FCC to extend a waiver
it granted to the commission to delay implementation of 10-digit dialing
in the Chicago metropolitan area until April 1.

On Jan. 17 North American Numbering Plan administrator (NANPA) NeuStar,
Inc., informed the ICC that the last NXX code in the ""847"" area code had
been assigned and that the first NXX code in the ""224"" ""overlay"" would
be assigned in 30 days.  Activation would occur 90 days thereafter.

Assuming that NANPA is correct, and that there are no NXX codes in the
847 NPA that should be returned, activation of the first code in the 225
NPA may occur on or after May 17, the ICC said..  It said its success
forestalling exhaustion of the five Chicago codes may cause the
temporary waiver to expire before activation of a single new NXX code in
the 224 overlay or any other Chicago area code.  (CC docket 96-98)

WIRELESS
HAWAII
Bill targets drivers' use of handheld wireless phones

Rep. K. Mark Takai (D., District 34) has introduced HB 225 to make it
illegal to drive while talking on a handheld wireless phone.  Persons
convicted of using their wireless phones while driving would face a
maximum $100 fine for a first offense.  Violators could face a maximum
$200 fine for second offenses and a maximum $500 fine for any additional
offenses.

In addition to the fines, anyone caught violating the measure would be
required to attend a traffic safety class and pay a $50 driver
assessment fee.

HB 225 would provide exemptions for any drivers making ""911"" emergency
calls, reporting traffic accidents, or having a reason to fear for their
lives.  The bill awaits consideration by House Transportation Committee
and the House Judiciary and Hawaiian Affairs Committee.

OKLAHOMA
Bill calls on OCC to provide EAS for every exchange

Sen. Frank Shurden (D., District 8) has prefiled SB 151 to require the
Corporation Commission to expand the state's current wide area calling
(or extended area service) plans to include every local exchange in the
state.  The OCC would have to implement wide area calling plans that
correspond to the areas served by the ""405,"" ""580,"" and ""918"" number
planning areas.

The bill acknowledges that the OCC can implement the wide area numbering
plans only to the extent possible under federal law.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT
MASSACHUSETTS
Bill would create nonprofit corporation to manage DTE info service

Sen. Linda J. Melconian (D., Hampden) has introduced SB 400 to create a
nonprofit corporation called Mass211, Inc., to administer the
information and referral service established by the Department of
Telecommunications and Energy.

Last year the DTE ordered the abbreviated dialing code ""211"" to be
assigned to the service.  The service will refer callers to agencies
that deal with domestic violence, substance abuse, elder services,
crisis intervention, health care, housing, food and fuel donations,
support groups, family counseling, and a range of other health and human
services.  (5/22/00 a.m.)

The bill has been referred to the Government Regulations Committee.  Its

Bills aim to protect consumer privacy

Legislators are considering three bills to enhance phone customers'
privacy.  Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky (D., District 86) has
introduced AB 1390 to prohibit the ""transmission of unsolicited bulk
electronic mail.""  The bill would establish criminal and civil penalties
to be assessed against violators of the proposed anti-spamming law.  AB
1390 has been referred to the Committee on Consumer Affairs and
Protection; its text is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01390.

Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer (D., District 67) has introduced AB 1668
to require local exchange carriers to provide, free of charge, unlisted
telephone numbers for victims of domestic violence.  The bill has been
referred to the Committee on Corporations.  Its text is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01669.

AB 1589, sponsored by Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr. (D., District 43),
aims to protect users of cordless and mobile phones against
eavesdropping.  The measure would prohibit the ""mechanical overhearing
of a conversation"" when the person ""overhearing the conversation knows
that it emanates"" from a cordless or mobile telephone.  The bill resides
in the Committee on Codes.  Its text is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01589.

MISSOURI
PSC gives ALLTEL more time to comply with billing rules

The Public Service Commission has granted ALLTEL Missouri, Inc.'s
request for an extension until March 31 to comply with two new billing
rules.  The commission's order adopts an agreement reached by ALLTEL,
the commission staff, and the public counsel.

On Sept. 22, 2000, ALLTEL told the PSC it couldn't update fully its
billing program to accommodate the new rules until March 31 and asked
for an exemption until that time.  The billing rules went into effect at
the end of October 2000.

The agreement calls for ALLTEL to continue sending its traditional
notice of discontinuance until the company begins following a new rule
on ""discontinuance of service to residential customers.""  In addition,
the agreement requires ALLTEL to review manually each account for which
service is at risk of being disconnected until the company implements
the new billing rules.  The agreement also asked ALLTEL to continue
sending notices to customers who haven't paid their accounts.  The
notices must inform customers when they must pay to avoid losing
service.

The PSC's order is available at

As part of an effort to facilitate communication on the trading floor, we 
have set everyone up with Microsoft Messenger.  
For those of you not familiar with the program, Microsoft Messenger allows 
you to talk real time with anyone on your contact 
list.  The program also has voice capabilities if you have a microphone.  
Messenger should now be fully installed on your 
computer and is accessible from the Start Menu.

You will need to set up a Hotmail account in order to use this service.  
Please follow the link below to set up your account. 
Once you have created an ID, please email me back with your ID so that I can 
compile a contact list for everyone on the floor.  
Let me know if you need help getting set up.  

http://hotmail.com

A word of caution when using the program.  Because this is not behind the 
company firewall, anything you send is not 100% secure and 
could be intercepted by a third party.  Any sensitive pricing information 
that you do not want disclosed should not be transmitted over
the program.

I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you with a revision of the
paper.

Attached please find a revised summary by Tim Koller.  We hope it reflects
well the discussion of our previous meeting. Before the next meeting, it is
our intention to send along the longer discussion paper that would mirror
this summary.  I suggest this next meeting take place as a conference call
at one of the following times.  Please indicate with an ""X"" in the boxes
next to the proposed dates which dates are good for you.

               Monday, November 20, 5 p.m. EST     [ X  ]

               Tuesday, November 21, 5 pm EST      [   ]

               Monday November 27, 6 pm EST        [ X  ]


We would like to get everyone's views in advance of this conference call,
either in writing or by phone.  Please indicate below what your preference
would be.  If a call is preferred, Valerie Petersen will contact your
office
to set it up.


               Call [   ]

               Writing   [   ]

There will be one last meeting scheduled after the conference call meeting
takes place to go over the final draft.

Look forward to hearing from you.

The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties in due diligence relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and Enron Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:

The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to Enron will carry Enron Corp guaranties.
The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors.
The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and Enron and the rest of it's subsidiaries.

Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between Enron and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

Mike/Chris: 
So far, our research only shows 1/3/01 OOM transactions with TID ( on that 
date you should have received 175 MW of OOM at $250 throughout the day per 
attached spreadsheet).  We see no other OOM transactions for the additional 
Trade Dates you have listed on your spreadsheet.  The next step would be to 
get the specifics on the OOM purchases.  Was it with ISO or CERS?   Do you 
have transcripts of OOM calls?

Mike and Chris: 
The original Market Invoice for January, 2001 transactions was faxed to 
Leslie B. at 209-656-2147 on March 27, 2001. 
I am researching some of these transactions to see if I can get specific 
data breakdown on the charges.  Do you have the hours for these transactions 
for each day?

Aron got for the Secretary Richardson fundraiser (last April) and the tab is 
$2500.  I know in hindsight we may not want to give Richardson any money 
since he blew his chance at becoming VP (just joking) but we do need to pay.  
Tom's email address is above and perhaps he can tell you where to mail the

I also have a couple of other obligations that Tim Aron undertook that I need

Hi All,
For those of you that don't know I am currently on a 7 week trip through
Africa, from Nairobi to Vic Falls, with my brother John-Henry. This will be
our means of updating all you boring non-traveller types of our adventures.
We arrived yesterday safe and well in Nairobi. We were tired, but had a full

day visiting an animal orphanage that raised these animals and set them back

into the wild. We were very priviledged to pet baby elephants, rhino and
zebra. We had a meeting of the folks we are travelling with and they all
seem really nice. All in their early 20's and I think I am mingling in well.

There are 8 of us on a truck made for 20 so lots of room. Last night we went

to a carvery that specialised in the local wildlife. Crocs, Zebra, antelope
that sort of thing. Today has been a long drive into Tanzania, to a place
called Arusha, from here we go off on a 3 day game drive over the serengeti.

We are staying in a place called Snakepark, which is a little unnerving, but

hell thats what we are here for.
We are both fit, well, happy and a little pink. I gave the first of those
little toys out today mum, there was a ?3yr old when we stopped for
charcoal. It took her a few minutes to touch the wiggling frog, but she
loved it. I had to bribe the others with pens so they didn't snatch it off
her. We are off now to eat as we skipped lunch and it is about 4.30pm.
Love to you all
Tessa and J-H

Hey Folks,

How is old blightey!!!
What a week J-H and I have had.
The 3 day safari around the Serengetti and Ngorongoro Crater was fantastic.
The 8 of us were split between 2 landrovers, that the rooves came off so we
had a really good view. We saw loads of game, basically everything. I was
most impressed with the 7 rhino - ok so 6 of them were in the distance and
we only knew they were rhino by looking through nans fantastic binoculars, a

quick thankyou to nan for lending them to me. And 6 cheetahs as I had seen
niether on my previous safari. Other things included 2 eagles eating an
impala up a tree, a leopard must have killed it and taken it up there, we
sat and watched a very bossy male zebra organising this whole herd of zebra
in and out of a watering hole in groups. Also elephant, lions - lots,
especially 11 sat on a large rock together, hippos, hyena, wildebeast,
warthogs, waterbuffalow, crocodile. I have probably left loads out, but you
get the drift, J-H made a list. In the evenings we camped and you will all
get to here J-h's story of the lion, but it is his story - niether lion nor
boy were harmed.
I will have to finish this tomorrow as I have loads more to say, but I have
to meet my group for a sunset beer.
Thanks Mandy for passing all this on. Give mum our love and reassure her
that J-H is really coming into his own.
Ross- don't you dare start lecturing me about settling down, you are only
doing it now and you are a dinosaur compared to me.

Love you all loads, and thanks for the replies.

Tessa

Ok Folks,
Where was I?
If you are interested we just made sunset last night and had a very welcome
cold beer.
Back to the adventure! The campsites we say in vary hugely, we range from
ones with just a hole in the ground toilet facility - like the one in the
Serengetti, to ones with proper toilets, showers with warmish water and
fully stocked bars!! In the Serengetti we were very close to nature. Too
close, we all went to bed early - this seems to be a bit of a trend, bed
before 10 most nights and up at 6, we have even made it up before sunrise a
few times. But the stories going between tents in the serengetti were of the

campers that have been lost to lions. Sure enough we certainly saw evidence
of their presence in the camp when we got up in the morning, even without
J-H's story. The next night after a long game drive, we camped on the edge
of the Ngorongoro crater, a bit windy, but warm, then as soon as the sun
went down it was bitterly cold and we huddled round the fire to eat our
supper, but all retreated to our sleeping bags soon after. It actually
turned out to be the best night sleep some of us had, especially as I always

find a lumpy bit of ground. I share a tent with a girl from Huddersfield
called Helen and we have the putting up and dismantling of the tent down to
a fine art.
The crater was fantastic, very bumpy and we were being thrown around the
back of the landrover as the driver did his best to get in front of a Rhino,

he did a brilliant job and it meant that the rhino passed by really closely.

That evening we went back to the snake park, to find our intrepid leaders
had finished doing some work on the truck. We were all desperate for
showers, even though you get dusty and mucky again very quickly it is lovely

for a while. We tried our best to wash our clothes, and managed to get the
semi clean. Since then Helen and I have discovered that it is easier to pay
a local to clean them properly and it only costs 15p for a pair of trousers.
The next day we played with the snakes for a while in the morning, they have

a baby pyhton we are allowed to hold, then J-H had a ride on a camel.
We went into Arusha to do a few things and stayed at a campsite the other
side of town, just to knock 20mins of the journey the next day. The cooking
has become a bit of a competition, J-H and I did the first dinner, rice and
stir fried veggies. Everyone thought it was great and it set a challenge for

the others, so people get a bit worried before its their turn. Since we did
just veggies, people have been adding meats, doing selection of salads,
cooking the rice with cashew nuts. It is getting like Ready Steady Cook,
when they started the chefs only did maincourses, now they do 5 course
dinners!!
We started the next day at 4.30am, it is a long drive from Arusha to Dar Es
Salaam, but we got to see the best sunrise over mount Kilimanjaro. During
these drives we are very pleased to be a select group, cos it means we get
to spread out and sleep. When we don't sleep it is really interesting to
watch the world go by and wave at the locals. They must be used to seeing
the trucks as quite a few do the same route, ours is the scruffiest - we are

very proud.
The campsite in Dar was right on the beach, we all ran in fora swim mand
gave up after we were over 100 yards in and syill only knee deep.
We had a morning in Dar and took the afternoon ferry over to Zanzibar. We
all fell deeply in love, it is the most beautiful place. We are staying in a

hotel here, Helen and I were in raptures over the ensuite bathroom and
airconditioning. We showered quickly and went off for dinner. In Stone Town
there is an evening market that is mainly selling cooked food, so you wander

down and take your pick. The first night I had tuna, squid and lobster, to
give you and idea, the lobster cost me about 80p. The group decided there
and then that we are setting up a commune here and turning our back on
civilisation.
Anywhere I can dine nightly on lobster gets my vote. We went on a spice tour

of the island yesterday, they grow everything from nutmeg to chilli to
cumerin. And all the fruit, bannanas, star fruit, mangos, pineapple, apples,

lemons etc etc, eat home even has their own tree that produces iodine for
any cuts they may get.
Obviously we went back to the market for dinner, J-H has challenged himself
to try and eat 5000 shillings worth - about 4 pounds, so far he is up to
3000. Today is a lazy day, postcards will be written etc. Tomorrow we are
off to stay at a deserted beach on the east of the island. This has been a
long e-mail - mainly for the family - cause the internet places will be few
and far between when we hit Malawi next week, so you may not here from us
for a week or 2. We will try whenever we can.
Love to all in breezy old England
Tessa

Dear All,

This is our last day in Zanzibar. We have just come back from the East
coast. It was very pretty, with few tourists or hotels. Unfortunately this
made the food and drinks more exspensive - ok, so we may only be talking
about 8p, but we are in cheap-sake travelling mood. There was also not a lot

to do, so it was 2 days of lying in the shade - the sun being too hot -
reading, playing cards and looking for shells on the beach. Boy what a tough

life I have!!
Our swahili is up to about 8 or so words.
Jambo - hello
Habari - how are you
Mizuri - beautiful
Mizuri-sana - very beautiful
Santa-sana - thankyou very much
Karibu - welcome
Fiti-Fiti - slang for very well
Thats about it.
Today we went to swim with the dolphins on the south coast. Apparently
nobody informed the dolphins and only a couple of pods turned up and they
were not in the playing mood. We got quite close to them and as soon as
anyone jumped into the water they were off - honestly you just can't get the

dolphins!!
Then we snorkelled on the reef for a while, there seemed to be quite a bit
of damage. I was really annoyed by a fella that kept diving underneath me
and picking things off the coral. Some people are sooo ignorant - sorry
Ulli, I love you to pieces - but they were bloody Germans.
We have our last meal at the harbour stalls tonight and take the 10pm ferry
back to Dar. Because of some silly rule they won't let us into Dar until
6am, so we kip on board ship.
Then we are back to our wonderfully dusty old truck and more bush camps.
As I said before Malawi is very poor and unlikely to have lots of internet
cafes so it may be a week or 2 before the next one.

Loads of Love
Tessa

Subject: The Adventure Continues
Date: Sat, 19 Feb 2000 07:46:55 -0500

Dear All,

Welcome back mum and dad, hope India was fab. The gang over here think the
Weltons are trying to take over the world.
Well, it has been a long time since the last update. This is due to Malawi
being a very friendly but poor country.
The adventures in the last 9 days are too much to go into too much detail.
The partying started in ernest at Lake Malawi, up until then the driver
thought we were a little slow, I was up late, but everyone else was flaking.

Our first big night the weltons did well, winning a drinking game each and
not being any of the 3 people that passed out. The next big night a few days

later we didn't do so well, the other boys think it is very amusing to get
J-H plastered and they have found 2 drinking games that he is really bad at.

He has even started praticing on the truck as we travel around. That night
though was a bad taste night and we had all had a budget and went to a
clothes market and bought each other outfits. Everyone was hoping I looked
bad, but a very nice unimaginative bloke just bought me an overall, I was
disappointed. All the lads had frocks, J-H had a fetching orange silky
blouse and silky skirt, he looked surprisingly fetching. Slightly less so
when passed out on the toilets 3 hrs later, or passed out on the floor in
front of the toilets, and he annoyed a few people when he woke up at 4.30 am

demanding to know where the party was - loudly. Apart from the parties we
have seen and done other things we have visited a school, a hospital, a
mountain or 2, had a tribal village meal and a brewery. That last one was
really tough. The gang are getting on really well, some how a hitch-hiker
has joined us, but he's cool. We had a couple of days of heavy rain, so
people were getting fed up with the tents, the mozzies have been on great
form, but its Africa and we love it. The crew have been trying to persuade
us to stay till Cape Town and if I didn't have fixed plans I would be here a

few more months. I shall return.
Now we are in Harare the capital of Zim. Just to make any of you sports
lovers sick, we have found out where the England cricket team are and will
be going to their hotel to watch the 6-nations rugby this pm and supporting
them in their one day against Zim tomorrow. As I said its a hard life. Last
night we went to a local night club and the band were amazing and still
going when we left at 3.30 am. I have just enough time to do a spot of
shopping before going to find Goughie and the boys.
I have probably left loads out, but nevermind, you are all going to have to
listen to my stories anyway.
Tessa

0,"Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and 
complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk 
of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions 
with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.  
Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial 
people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back 
and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and 
standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it 
helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the 
long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, 
less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. 

A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get 
in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth 
et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized 
delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't 
quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish 
some of these goals as well.

In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  

Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.

Regards
Delainey

Subject: Reporting Structure

Dave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the 
following. As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all 
other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT) 
report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. 

In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to 
me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the 
following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these 
individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than 
not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given 
somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea 
whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. 

Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing 
with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in 
Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and 
point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling 
unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was 
putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with 
Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very 
demotivated lawyer on my hands.

Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to ""stay 
in the loop"" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a 
dollar and time perspective.  

Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think 
its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I 
know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, 
inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between 
Houston and the employee.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

Regards
Milnthorp

Subject: Azurix

Stan, 
Today is Diane Bazelides' last day of work at Azurix. Over the last month, 
Diane and I have met several times to transition the Azurix Public Relations 
function into ETS. Shelley and I also met with John Garrison. As you know, 
Azurix has a lot of irons in the fire and many of them could turn into public 
relations challenges. 
Azurix has PR employees in Buenos Aires, Ontario, and California. These 
employees were notified by Diane that I was taking over the Azurix PR 
function and to coordinate their activity through me. I've spoken to a few of 
the PR employees.
To summarize what Azurix might face in the near future, here's what Diane and 
John provided me and Shelley: 
? Offers to purchase Azurix North America are due May 24. John anticipates 
spending one month reveiwing the offers and making management presentations. 
As a deal is done and made public, information and responses to the media 
will be coordinated with Mark Hudson in Ontario. 
? The Madera project in California continues. Cole Frates is on the ground in 
California and I will coordinate with Cole as issues surface. 
? Gustavo Pedace is on the ground in Buenos Aires. If I had to guess, this is 
where Azurix has the most exposure. As July and August approach, we'll know 
more about the direction of Azurix Buenos Aires. 
? As things transpire with the other assets, I'll coordinate PR activity with 
the contacts on the ground. Mark Palmer and his staff know that ETS is 
involved in Azurix. 
I have a phone call into John Shafer to discuss the use of the crisis center 
in case of an Azurix emergency. This is a precautionary measure that I hope 
we don't have to use.
Please let me know if you would like to discuss Azurix and the PR function 
further. 
Gina

Everything About Enron's Insurance Programs

That You Were Afraid To Ask

(or Didn't  Know to Ask)

Presented by
David Marshall
Enron Corporate Risk Management

Thursday, January 11, 2001
11:30 - 1:00

The Houston Room
601 Jefferson
(We've reserved the Enron Shuttle to transport the ""non-walkers"")

Lunch will be served.  Please RSVP to Pat Radford at 39282.

One of the goals of Jeff Hodge and Barbara Gray is to increase the level of 
departmental information sharing activities.  Since we are faced on a daily 
basis with insurance matters in contract drafting and client advising, the 
East/Upstream Origination and Trading Group felt it would be productive to 
have Enron's Corporate Risk Management Group give a presentation on current 
Enron Insurance Programs, policies and contractual risk allocation 
preferences.  It then occured to us that this subject might be of interest to 
all of the lawyers on the 38th floor.   Please join us next Thursday.   

Sorry for the inconvenient location.  We'll make it worth your while with the 
quality of the food and the presentation.

Subject: Unresolved Issues for Jan 1.- Followup

Here is a followup to the memo sent on 12/31/99.  FYI


Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we 
stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get 
this assigned?  I can find old
   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let 
me know. Unresolved - appears to be unassigned?  We no longer do business on 
Enron Field Services.

Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for 
ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1. Unresolved  We should 
have a sale to Entex.   The deal will be enrtered in Sitara.

MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and 
Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with 
transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it 
stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I 
thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.  Unresolved  
We have a sale on ECT to Entex in Sitara.

Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:

 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left 
unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed 
appropriately.  Someone
  needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, 
that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified.

 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This 
issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot 
allocate was is
  not pathed and nominated.  Unresolved or Unpathed?  Carlos is looking into 
this.

 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point 
specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 
10,000).  This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the 
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this 
transaction, we are not legally covered.  Carlos was handling this pipe in 
Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan? Unresolved  Carlos nom'd this to 
Channel.  He knows the contract and rate (negotiated by Elsa).

HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December 
and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back 
next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return. 
I haven't had time to do this yet.  If we haven't figured out the assignement 
then I will get to it asap.

I heard about the videos at your offsite and I'm hoping people will take your lead.  VHS shot on someone's Sony will be great!  Innovision has also agreed to work with any team to simply provide editing services for them.

As for the $10,000 figure ... I was concerned that if ""outsourcing"" wasn't an option, we wouldn't get many entries.  But the cheaper the better -- there will be recognition given to the best ""independently produced"" video.

Thanks for your input and I hope Enron Americas will have a submission.

You should give zero budget for videos, not 10,000.  We did this for our offsite and it worked fine.

Subject:	Enron Management Conference - Home Video Project


The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous ""Home Video"" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, ""Enny"" will also be awarded for ""Best Overall Video.""

If you have any questions about the ""Home Video"" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

the California power crisis and testimony to the Senate Energy, Utilities and 
Communications Committee by the CEO of CAL-ISO concerning the power 
issues/problems.

Testimony before Senate Energy, Utilities & Communications Committee And the 
Assembly Utilities & Commerce Committee
By Terry M. Winter, President and CEO
California Independent System Operator
August 10, 2000




An August 10th article from Natural Gas Intelligence that talks of the 
defensive posture the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) has 
taken concerning the accusations that Governor Davis' emergency electricity 
report had made about the new deregulated market. 



An article from Natural Gas Intelligence talks about the vote, on July 31st,  
by the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) Board to move the 
price cap to $250. The pros and cons of the price cap are mentioned, as well 
as other remedies for the power situation. Also, there are several comments 
in the article from California Senator Steve Peace on how ""dysfunctional"" the 
market is and why it should be restructured. 


"
0,"This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.

Thank You,

Larry May"

0,"We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=

continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=

f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20

=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=

This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20

		 Subject: Update on Gabrielle Grace


There have been many inquiries about Gabrielle, so I thought I would give 
everybody an update.  Unfortunately, the prognosis is not good.  She has had 
many complications since the surgery (chest fluid, blood clots, infections, 
and fluctuating blood pressure due to high blood acidity).  For the past 24 
hours, she has been relatively stable, but no improvements.  She is still in 
ICU and it could still go either way.  

When Jim's 2 1/2 year old son, Connor, visited Gabrielle on Monday, he looked 
at Jim and said ""Gabrielle wants to go home.""  Please keep her in your 
prayers.  

Thank you,
Dina
